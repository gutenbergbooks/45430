<p>"For its rapid action, in fact, we have seldom read a better story, or one
which is more full of incidents, sanguinary, trenchant, and robust."</p>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">The "Daily Telegraph."</span></div>

<p>"A true and a wonderfully well-sustained piece of Oriental life and
striking history."</p>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">The "Spectator."</span></div>

<p>"This is a very remarkable book. It is a determined attempt to bring
the interior Hindoo and Mussulman life of a great Mahratta province
during the most exciting times home to the hearts and understandings of
Englishmen, to interest them in people with whom they have nothing
except human nature in common."</p>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">"Morning Post."</span></div>

<p>"'Tara' is a unique work. There is nothing like it in the English
literature of fiction. No other writer has ever attempted the portrayal of
Indian life, society, and interests, entirely free from any European
admixture of character or incident. The author himself now does so for
the first time. 'The Confessions of a Thug' related to British jurisdiction
in India. 'Tippoo Sultan' dealt with the gallant struggles of that
monarch against the encroaching British power, but 'Tara' is all Indian."</p>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">"Saturday Review."</span></div>

<p>"It is seldom that we meet with a work of fiction executed with anything
like the conscientious care and minute elaboration of Captain Meadows
Taylor's Indian Tale. His characters have mostly the clearness and individuality
of portraits, and his scenery exhibits all the marked and decisive
features of photographs taken on the spot. The work throughout is
evidently that of a master of Oriental life and character in love with his
subject, to whom nothing appears trivial or beneath notice that can
illustrate the peculiar traits of Asiatic nature, or kindle an enthusiasm for
knowing more of the history, manners, and usages of our fellow-subjects
in the east."</p>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">The "Standard."</span></div>

<p>"In no one part of the work has Captain Taylor shown more thorough art
than in those pages in which he details the features of the Hindoo and
Mahomedan family life. He never overloads; his characters are not lay
figures attired in triple folds of gorgeous robes to hide their nakedness.
With a few subtle touches he shows us the interior life of each household,
and the morning springs of every character, and he leaves us to fill in the
obvious details for ourselves."<br /><br /></p>

<h2><a name="PROLOGUE" id="PROLOGUE">PROLOGUE.</a></h2>


<p>In the year 1839, I became acquainted with the late Professor
Wilson; and in course of conversation on the possibility of illustrating
events in Indian history by works of fiction, the details of
the present story, among other subjects, were slightly sketched
out by me. He was interested in them, and suggested my writing
the tale for "Blackwood's Magazine." I could not, however, then
commence it, and deferred doing so till my return to India; but,
falling into political and civil employment there, was never able to
continue what I had begun, till my return home.</p>

<p>The history of the period of this tale, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1657, will be found at
length in Scott's "Ferishta," and vol. i. of Grant Duff's "History
of the Mahrattas;" and to these works I beg to refer such of my
readers as may be curious in regard to its particulars, of which a
slight sketch may not, perhaps, be altogether out of place.</p>

<p>In <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1347, a great portion of the Dekhan was consolidated into
a kingdom by Sultan Alla-oo-deen, who founded the Bahmuni
dynasty. It was divided into three great provinces, Dowlatabad,
Beejapoor, and Golconda, which, on the decay of the royal house,
became separate kingdoms under their several viceroys, who successively
declared their independence. Of these, Beejapoor was
the largest, and became by far the most important and powerful.
Yoosuf Adil Shah, a Turk of European descent, believed, indeed, to
have been the son of a Sultan of Constantinople, threw off his
allegiance to the Bahmuni dynasty in <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1489, and established
himself at Beejapoor, which afterwards rose to be the greatest, as it
was the most magnificent, city of the Dekhan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span></p>

<p>The prosperity of the Dekhan kingdoms excited the jealousy of
the Moghul Emperors of Dehli, and their subjugation was projected
by the Emperor Akbur; but it had made little progress at his death
in <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1605. In the reign of his grandson Shah Jehán, the State of
Ahmednugger, or Dowlatabad, was finally subdued about 1630, and
the Moghul power so far established in the Dekhan. His son,
Aurungzeeb, pursued the reduction of the two remaining kingdoms,
Beejapoor and Golconda, with varying success, but untiring pertinacity;
and, before his death in 1707, they had succumbed to him.
Beejapoor fell on the 15th October, 1686; Golconda in September,
1687.</p>

<p>Amidst the struggles of the Mahomedans, the predatory power of
the Mahratta people arose under Sivaji, and assumed a more definite
form than it had ever before possessed; and, as the author of the
Mahratta History observes, "stirred those latent embers till, like
the parched grass kindled amidst the forests of the Syhadree
mountains, they burst forth in spreading flame, and men afar
wondered at the conflagration."</p>

<p>Of the many remarkable and romantic events connected with the
rise of the Mahratta power, those which form the subject of the
present tale are, of all, the most cherished by the people; and they
are recited, or sung in ballads, with an interest which time does not
diminish, and which has exalted the national hero, Sivaji Rajah, to
the distinction almost of a demigod.</p>

<p>At the period of the tale, 1657, though the political foundations of
Beejapoor were shaking, nothing had affected its material prosperity;
and the palaces, mosques, mausoleums, and other public buildings of
the capital, were in their greatest magnificence. The city itself,
except its vast fortifications, which are still perfect, has now, for the
most part, disappeared; and long lines of shapeless mounds, covering
an immense area, mark where its streets existed. In some quarters
there are villages, widely separated, which once formed part of the
general masses of habitations; and there are everywhere remains of
mosques, tombs, and palaces, which convey a true estimate of the
wealth of those for whom they were constructed, and the taste and
skill of the architects.</p>

<p>The citadel is still perfect as to walls, towers, and ditch, and is a
very complete and picturesque specimen of Puthán fortification.
The royal palaces situated in it, are, however, roofless, much ruined,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
and advancing to destruction; and the gardens and terraces, with
their fountains, are covered by brushwood and tangled creepers. It
is a happy thing, however, that the liberality of the Indian Government
has arrested decay, wherever practicable, and that all the most
beautiful buildings have been restored, while repairs continue to be
made as needful.</p>

<p>The buildings so restored are&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The Mausoleum of Ibrahim Adil Shah, called the Ibrahim Roza;<br />
The Mausoleum of Mahmood Adil Shah;<br />
The Méhturi Mahal;<br />
The Jumma Mosque;<br />
The Assar Shureef;<br />
The Royal Well, with its cloisters; and some others.<br />
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of the above, the Assar Shureef is one of the ancient royal palaces,
which contains some sacred relics; and, being in the actual condition
in which it was left, is perhaps the most interesting of all.</p>

<p>By orders of Government also, drawings from actual measurement
were made a few years ago by a clever civil engineer and architect,
of all the principal buildings. These are now in the India Library
in London; and, to any one curious on the subject, will give a far
better idea of the superb Saracenic architecture of the Adil Shahy
dynasty, than any description. Mahomedan architecture in India is
always beautiful; but there is a combination of grandeur and grace
about that of Beejapoor which is not approached elsewhere, and a
beauty of ornament and execution nowhere exceeded. The Jumma
Mosque, with its side aisles, was constructed for the accommodation
of eight thousand persons at prayer; and the superb dome of the
Mausoleum of Sultan Mahmood Adil Shah, built of hewn stone, is
the largest in its outward diameter in the world.</p>

<p>With these noble remains, the country around them, and its population
of all classes, I have been familiar for many years past; and
such descriptions of scenery and character as may be found in these
volumes, are the result of personal knowledge. The actors in my
story are Hindus and Mahomedans; but the same passions and affections
exist among them as among ourselves, and thus the motives
and deeds of my characters may, at least, be intelligible. I can only
hope they may prove of interest.</p>

<p>It was very strange, twenty-five years ago, to observe the remarkable
interval of exactly one hundred years, between the attack of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
Sivaji on the Beejapoor Mahomedans in 1657, and the victory of
Lord Clive over those of Bengal at Plassey in 1757. Both results led
directly to the establishment of powers widely differing in their aims
and characters, but not the less irresistible by the Mahomedans; and
the victory at Pertâbgurh was as directly conducive to the establishment
and extension of the Mahratta authority, and the decadence of
the Mahomedan, as that of Plassey has been to our own sovereignty,
and to the political extinction of both. But this curious accordance
of dates becomes still more interesting, when we observe that, on the
anniversary of a third century, June, 1857, the heads of Mahomedan
and Mahratta power were leagued against that which had subdued
both; and know that their combined efforts however desperate, and
their intrigues however virulent, proved alike futile.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I</a></h2>

<p>"Tara, O Tara! where art thou?"</p>

<p>"Mother, I am here. Is it time?"</p>

<p>"Yes; we should go with the offerings to the temple. Come,
thy father hath long been gone, and it will be broad day ere we can
reach it. Come," said her mother, entering a small open verandah
which skirted the inner court of the house, where the girl sat
reading by the light of a lamp, now paling before the dawn which
was fast spreading over the sky.</p>

<p>She shut her book with a reverential gesture, laid it aside in its
quilted cover, and stood up. How beautiful she was! Let us
describe this Brahmun girl to you, O reader! if we can, and tell
you a little concerning her.</p>

<p>There were many fair women of her sect in Tooljapoor, and they
are always the most remarkable of their country-women, but none
so fair as Tara, the daughter of Vyas Shastree.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> From her earliest
childhood she had given promise of grace and beauty, and since that
period&mdash;from the time when, hanging shyly to the skirt of her
mother's garment, she passed daily through the crowded bazaar
and street which led to the upper gate of the temple&mdash;to the present,
she had ever been an object of remark and admiration; while the
rank and learning of her father, and his position as chief priest, had
maintained for her a continued and increasing interest as she grew
up. None who had the privilege of addressing her ever omitted a
loving greeting or respectful salutation: the public flower-sellers
intrusted her with their choicest garlands or nosegays to offer up at
the shrine&mdash;the confectioners had ever a delicate sweetmeat with
which to tempt the child&mdash;and even the rudest peasant or soldier
looked at her, as she passed him, in wonder, stretched out his hands
to her, and kissed the tips of his fingers in a worshipful salutation
and benediction.</p>
<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>
<p>The promise of the child was more than fulfilled in the girl now
budding into early womanhood; and her appearance was so remarkable
that, while many of her old friends in the bazaar now rarely
ventured to accost her, and even turned aside their heads reverently
as she passed, she could not traverse the crowded street which led
from her house to the temple, or, indeed, move anywhere during
the day without attracting admiration from the crowds of strangers
who, from all parts of India, visited that renowned shrine of which
her father was the chief priest and manager. Many a pilgrim and
worshipper gazed wonderingly upon the calm, gentle face which
met him at the earliest dawn in its devotional perambulation round
the temple, or followed with his eye the graceful figure which,
carrying the daily sacrificial offerings, descended the flights of steps
by which the shrine was approached; and, far away in his native
village, under the snows of Himalaya, the burning sands of Raméshwur,
or the green plains of Bengal, told of the beautiful vision,
and never forgot it.</p>

<p>Tara has been up since before the false dawn. She has assisted
her father with water to bathe, and in his private worship of the
household gods. She has bathed herself, and is now dressed in the
simple saree, or robe of all Hindu females. It is of dark blue silk,
striped with a fainter blue, and has a broad border of a light but
rich pattern harmonizing with the colours of the garment which,
consisting of one long piece only, is wound round her several times
to form a skirt, then passed about her body and over her head on
the left side, whence the end, which is of rich gold tissue interwoven
with crimson flowers and green leaves, hangs heavily over her right
shoulder and back. Below the garment is a closely-fitting bodice
of striped orange silk only; but no portion of it is visible except a
little of the sleeve above the elbow. Tara is holding the border of
her dress close to her cheek, as if to conceal it even from her mother;
and the graceful outline of her arm may be followed, from the tips
of the taper fingers past the wrist partly covered with purple bangles
and a massive gold ring, along the soft round arm to the dimpled
elbow, whence it is lost among the folds of the saree which falls
over it.</p>

<p>Do you expect that her complexion will be fair like that of our
own northern girls? Ah, no! that would not harmonize with the
dress or the country; and yet it is very fair. Not a deep rich olive,
but what seems at a first glance pale and colourless; yet the skin is
so glossy and transparent that the warm glow of her blood is suffused
under it with the least passing emotion or excitement, which, as it
fades, leaves, as you think, a more beautiful tint behind.</p>

<p>And the features harmonized with the colour. To a casual
observer their expression was almost one of habitual sadness, yet it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
was not so in reality: there was calm, which as yet had known no
rude ruffling&mdash;a sweetness that was index to a simple, loving, trustful
mind. True, she had cares beyond those of ordinary household
occurrences, and these had no doubt increased the pensive expression
always remarkable. So her countenance was not easy to describe:
nor could you account very well for the patient, care-enduring look
which met you from one so young. What every one saw first, were
the soft brown eyes, shaded with long eyelashes which rested upon
the cheek. Ordinarily perhaps, or if seen when cast down, these
eyes appeared nowise remarkable; yet if passing emotions were
noticed, they closed when she was merry, till only a bright spark
of light remained glistening through the long lashes; and again, if
surprise, wonder, or admiration were excited, they suddenly expanded,
so that one looked into a depth of clear glowing colour,
violet and brown, the expression of which could not be fathomed.
But habitually they were modest, pensive, and gentle&mdash;full of intelligence,
and seemed to correspond with a low musical cadence of
voice perfectly natural, yet assisted, perhaps, by the habit of reading
and studying aloud, which she had learned from her father. In
those calm eyes there was as yet no passion of any kind. Some
suffering, perhaps, but no rough awakening to the reality of life.</p>

<p>The rest of her face left nothing to be desired. The Brahmuns of
Western India usually possess features more European in their character
than those of the same sect in other parts of the country, and
in this respect the women share them with the men, if they do not,
indeed, exceed them. So Tara had a soft oval face, with small full
lips and mouth, a thin straight nose with nostrils almost transparent,
which seemed to obey the passing emotions of her countenance.
Though the features were soft, they were neither insipid nor weak
in character; on the contrary, they appeared full of a woman's best
strength&mdash;endurance and patience; while, in the full glossy chin
and throat, enough of determination was expressed to show firmness
and consistency of no common order. Except the eyes, perhaps,
there was no feature of the face which could be called exactly
beautiful, yet the whole combined to create an expression which was
irresistibly interesting and charming; and where all harmonized,
separate portions were not remarked.</p>

<p>Every movement of her lithe form was displayed by the soft silk
drapery which fell over it in those graceful folds which we see expressed
in ancient statues, and it was cast in those full yet delicately
rounded proportions which sculptors have best loved to imitate.
Standing as she was, the girl had fallen into an attitude which was
most expressive: her head raised and turned to meet her mother's
entrance: a delicate naked foot, with a chain anklet of gold resting
on it, put out from beneath her robe: her eyes open, yet not to their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
full width: and her lips apart, disclosing the even glistening teeth:&mdash;she
appeared, in her arrested movement, as if she waited some
further communication from her mother, or had herself one to make
before she stirred.</p>

<p>No wonder that, as each morning she left the house with her
mother to pay her devotions at the temple, and passed along with
downcast eyes, her graceful figure attracted increased attention day
by day. Many a good wish followed her&mdash;many a benediction from
the aged poor of the town, to whom her charities were liberally dispensed;
and it might be, too, that other admiration, less pure in its
character, also rested upon her, and often, unknown to her, dogged
her steps.</p>

<p>The contrast between Tara and her mother was in most respects a
striking one. No one could deny that Anunda Bye was a handsome
woman; her neighbours and gossips told her so, and she quite believed
it. She looked, too, very young of her age; and as she sailed
down or up the street leading to the temple, and received the
humble salutations of shopkeepers, flower-sellers, and all the tradesmen
of that busy quarter, with an air which plainly showed how
much she considered it due to her rank and station&mdash;it would have
been difficult to say whether the timid girl following her, and
screening her face from the gaze of the people as she moved along,
was her daughter or youngest sister. Either she might be, and it
seemed more probable the latter, than the former.</p>

<p>Taller than her daughter as yet, Anunda Bye was not without
much of the same grace of figure; but it was cast on a bolder scale.
The features were more decided and prominent, the colour several
shades darker. The face, handsome as it was, had little of the
softening element of intellectuality in it; and Anunda was ignorant
of everything but household management, in which she excelled, in
all departments, to a degree that made her the envy of her female
acquaintance, and her husband the envied of his male associates
whose domestic affairs were not conducted with the same regularity,
and whose cookery was not so good.</p>

<p>Enter the Shastree's house at any time, and you were at once
struck with its great neatness. The floor was always plastered
with liquid clay by the women-servants when he was absent at the
temple for morning worship, and retained a cool freshness while it
dried, and, indeed, during the day. It was generally decorated by
pretty designs in white and red chalk powder dropped between the
finger and thumb, in the execution of which both mother and
daughter were very expert and accomplished. The Shastree's seat,
which was, in fact, a small raised dais at one side of the large room,
was usually decked with flowers, while upon the floor before it, the
greatest artistic skill was expended in ornament by Tara and her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
mother. Above it were pictures of favourite divinities, painted
in distemper colour: the amorous blue-throated Krishna playing
to the damsels of Muttra; the solemn four-armed Ganésha, sitting
with a grave elephant's head on his shoulders; the beautiful
Lakshmee and Suruswuti, the goddesses of wealth and learning,
the objects of household adoration: and the terrible six-armed
Bhowani in her contest with the demon Mahéshwur, in commemoration
of which the temple had been erected&mdash;all surrounded by
wreaths of flowers interwoven with delicate border patterns;&mdash;had
been partly executed by the Shastree himself, and partly by Tara,
who followed his tastes and accomplishments after a pretty fashion.
Thus decorated, the dais had a cheerful effect in the room: and
choice and intimate friends only were admitted to the privilege of
sitting upon it.</p>

<p>The house itself was perhaps in no degree remarkable. Outside,
facing the street, was a high wall, with a large door within a
projecting porch or archway, which had a seat on either hand as
you entered. The door-frame was richly carved, and on each side
a horse's head projected from the upper corner. Above the door,
in a space left for the purpose, was written in red Sanscrit letters,
"Sree Martund Prussunn," "The holy Martund protects;" and
Martund was one of the appellations of Siva. This legend was
surrounded by wreaths of flowers in the same colour; and across
the whole was a garland of mango leaves now withered, which had
hung there since the last festival.</p>

<p>As you entered the court, the principal room was before you, on
the basement of the house, which you ascended by three steps. It
was a wide open verandah, extending the width of the court, supported
upon seven wooden pillars, also richly carved, on which
crossed square capitals were fixed, and from these, beams were laid
to form the roof. This verandah was double; the inner portion
being raised a step above the other to form a dais, and at each
end of the inner portion were two small rooms in the corners, one
of which was the Shastree's library. The whole of these verandahs
could be shut in closely by heavy curtains of quilted cotton, neatly
ornamented by devices of birds and flowers, which hung between
the pillars; but usually all was open, or closed only by transparent
blinds of split cane suspended outside.</p>

<p>Having a northern aspect, this room was always cool, and was
the ordinary resort of the Shastree. Here he received his friends
and neighbours, held disputations, and instructed his pupils. The
women seldom entered it except in the evenings when undisturbed;
for, though unsecluded from men, a certain degree of reserve and
retirement is always observable in the women of Hindu families.
There was no ornament about the main apartment except the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
Shastree's dais, and the borders painted about the niches and
architraves of the doors; but it was kept a pure white, and was
scrupulously clean.</p>

<p>In the centre of the back wall of the inner verandah was a door
which opened into a second court, round which was a verandah
also open, and, leading from it on three sides, sleeping chambers
and a bath-room. In this verandah there was nothing but a few
spinning-wheels and their low stools; for Anunda Bye had no idea
of allowing women-servants to be idle, and when they were not
working otherwise, they were spinning cotton yarn for their own
clothes. Anunda herself had her wheel, and Tara hers, and
sometimes they spun yarn fine enough for the Shastree's waist-cloths.</p>

<p>On the fourth side of the court was the kitchen, and, passing by
it, a door led into a third court, more private, though not so large
as the second. In the centre of it was an altar painted in distemper,
on which grew a bush of toolsee or sweet basil, grateful to the
gods; and in the verandah, another altar, similar in form, on
which burned the sacred fire never extinguished. Close to it was
the door of the private temple of the house, which contained the
household gods of the family. Here it was that Tara best loved
to sit when her share of domestic affairs was completed. Here
she tended the sacred fire, and offered worship, such as a woman
could perform, in the temple. She had a small garden in one
corner of the court, which contained a few jessamine bushes, marigolds,
and other common flowers, which she cultivated for offerings
to the household gods in the daily worship. Here she could study
undisturbed, and did so with all her heart&mdash;here, too, it was that
her mother found her.</p>

<p>There was no decoration about the house, except, as we have
already mentioned, border patterns and quaintly designed birds and
flowers upon the walls. Furniture, such as we need, was unknown.
A small cotton or woollen carpet laid down here and there, with a
heavy cotton pillow covered with white calico, sufficed for sitting
or reclining; and as the goddess Bhowani, in her incarnation at
Tooljapoor, does not choose, as is believed, that any one in the
town should lie upon a bed except herself, a cotton mattress on the
floor, or a cool mat, sufficed for sleeping.</p>

<p>The house, therefore, would have appeared bare in any of my
readers' eyes; but it was neat and pleasant to look at: and one
can imagine, though decorated in a higher style of art, the
Roman houses at Pompeii to have been similar in most respects
of plan and domestic arrangement.</p>

<p>There was no evidence of wealth, yet the Shastree was a prosperous
man; and could you have seen Anunda Bye's stores of copper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
and brass utensils&mdash;large vessels for boiling vast quantities of
rice on festivals and household ceremonies&mdash;her brass lamps and
candelabra, her silver plates for eating from, and silver drinking
vessels;&mdash;could you have seen the contents of her private room,
in which were sundry large chests, full of sarees, or women's garments,
of great value; some heir-looms, woven with gold and
silver thread, each having its peculiar history; the shawls which
belonged to her husband, the gifts of princes and nobles, tributes to
his learning, of which she was very proud;&mdash;could you have seen, too,
the strong box that lay hidden among the clothes in the largest chest,
full of family jewels and ornaments, among which were two necklaces
of fine pearls, massive gold ornaments for ankles and wrists, for neck
and ears;&mdash;could you have seen all these, and the heavy gold cinctures
round Anunda's and Tara's trim waists, and their massive gold bracelets
and anklets,&mdash;you would have been envious, my dear reader, of
considerable wealth in this particular.</p>

<p>Otherwise, indeed, the Shastree was a man of substance. Being
an only son, with no other sharers, at his father's death, he had inherited
a considerable property. He had himself earned, by his
scholarly abilities, a small estate in a neighbouring province,
the rent of which was punctually paid, and was improving, for
he was a good landlord. He derived a handsome income from
the temple service, and from the offerings made to him as head
of the establishment. He farmed some land, too, near the town,
on the bank of the small river Bóree, and had an excellent garden
near the village of Sindphul, in the plain below the hills, the daily
supply of vegetables from which was very profitable from the large
and constant consumption in the town. Finally, as one of the most
learned Sanscrit scholars of the Dekhan, his instruction was held
in deserved repute, and his classes were attended by young Brahmuns
from all parts of the country, from whom he received fees
according to their means.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</a></h2>


<p>In many respects Vyas Shastree was a remarkable man, and, very
deservedly, he was held in great respect throughout the country.
No one could look on him without being conscious of his extreme
good breeding and intellectuality. Well made, there was no appearance
of great strength, though in the town gymnasium, as a
youth, he had held his own among the wrestlers, and had even
been famous as a sword-player. Those were troubled times,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
when a knowledge of weapons was needed by all men, and even
peaceful merchants and priests did not neglect the use of them;
but, as he grew older, the Shastree had laid aside these exercises,
and spare, strong, muscular arms were perhaps the only evidence
of them that remained. Certainly the head and face were fine.
The forehead was high and broad, slightly wrinkled now, and
furrowed by parallel lines. The head was shaved, except the lock
behind, and its intellectual organs were prominent. The eyebrows,
strongly marked, but not bushy, projected boldly over
expressive eyes of a deep steel grey, which were very bright and
clear, and a prominent nose of Roman character, which corresponded
with a well-shaped mouth and chin. Certainly it was
a handsome face&mdash;pale, sallow perhaps in colour, yet healthy, and
which occasionally assumed a noble and even haughty expression;
but, ordinarily, it was good-humoured: and evidently elevated and
purified in character by intellectual pursuits.</p>

<p>The Shastree was a man of note, as we have said, as to learning
and accomplishments. He was a profound Sanscrit scholar; and
in law, grammar, and logic, with the deep metaphysics of the
Védas, and their commentators, he had few superiors. With
mathematics and astronomy to calculate eclipses and positions of
planets, he had sufficient acquaintance to assist an old friend, who
was infirm, in the arrangement of the "Tooljapoor Almanac," a
task by no means easy, as it included calculation of the eclipses of
the year, and astrological tables. Of the popular Poorans he had
less knowledge, or perhaps did not believe them; and, as many do
now in these later days, held more to the ancient Vedantic theism
than to the modern idolatry of the Pooranic worship. The
Shastree, as a devout Brahmun, had made pilgrimages, being
accompanied by his wife; and in disputations at Benares, Nuddea
in Bengal, and Gya&mdash;as well as at Madura and Conjevaram, in
the south of India&mdash;had gained credit, if not renown.</p>

<p>In lighter accomplishments, too, such as music, he had a fair
amount of knowledge, and sang sweetly the various R&#257;gs, Droopuds,
and other measures of the classic styles. He considered, perhaps,
ordinary songs below notice; yet when he relaxed, and was prevailed
upon to sing some of the plaintive ballads of his own Mahratta
country, to his own Vina accompaniment, or any of his own
compositions, the effect was very charming. Tara had been carefully
taught by him, and the neighbours often listened to her sweet
voice in the morning and evening hymns, and chants of the service,
in the little temple of the house. Yet with all this wealth,
which he shared liberally with the poor&mdash;all this worldly good and
honour&mdash;Vyas Shastree had two great cares which pressed upon him
heavily, and were shared by his wife. The first was that he had no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
son; the second, that his beautiful daughter was already a virgin
widow. And these were heavy griefs.</p>

<p>Anunda Bye had borne him two sons and a daughter, of which
Tara was the first-born. The others had followed, and had died
successively when giving promise of healthy childhood. In vain
had the parents made pilgrimages to the shrines in the Dekhan after
the death of the last son, and to Benares also, to propitiate Siva in
his holiest of temples, and had from time to time remitted propitiatory
gifts to his shrine&mdash;no further offspring followed. An heir was
not only desirable for the property, which, in default of one, must
devolve upon a very distant relative&mdash;but, in a higher degree, for
the performance of those ceremonies for himself and his family
after death, which could only be effectual from a son, real or
adopted.</p>

<p>Often had Anunda urged him to marry again, and assured him
of her love and protection to a young wife, as a mother or elder
sister; and she had even named several parties of good family who
would have considered an alliance with the Shastree a positive
honour. Why should he not marry? He was yet comparatively
young: men older than himself had married twice, nay thrice, or
till the object of their desire was accomplished. Why should he
not do the same? Was he too old at forty, nay, even less? So
urged his wife and his best friends.</p>

<p>Yet the Shastree had not consented. The fact was, he loved
Anunda very dearly; she had been a good and true wife to him.
He feared, too, a certain imperious tone of temper which he could
control, but which, in contact with a second and younger wife,
might change to jealousy, and become, to say the least, inconvenient.
Or, if he made new connections, there would be the
usual tribe of new relations to provide for, or to trouble him with
importunate demands. On the whole, it might be better to adopt
a son of that distant cousin who lived at Nassuk, and bring him
up as his own. In any form, his necessity was urgent, and
Anunda grew more and more earnest about the matter, and had
even induced Tara to join in it.</p>

<p>"If you had a son," she would say to her husband, "he would
be a young man before you were old. Even if you died, the
property would descend to him, and the ceremonies would be properly
performed. If you grew old, and I were with you, he would take
care of us and of Tara. Who will do this now?"</p>

<p>Yes, the echo in his heart was sad enough. Who would do so?
There might be two widows, perhaps, mother and daughter, both
left to the mercies of distant relatives who had no personal knowledge
of them, and to whom they would be as ordinary widows
only, no matter what amount of property they had brought with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
them&mdash;shaven, dressed in the coarsest and scantiest raiment, and
used for menial offices&mdash;perhaps worse. Yes! the echo&mdash;"who
would do so?"&mdash;often as the words were said, fell heavily on the
Shastree's heart; and recently he had told his wife that&mdash;"he would
think about it if his life were spared for another year; until after the
next unfavourable conjunction of planets"&mdash;"he would think about
it;" and so Anunda, without making any formal propositions, was
yet collecting information as to the appearance, character, property,
and accomplishments of many girls in the neighbourhood, and, in
short, wherever she had any acquaintance.</p>

<p>Most heavily, however, of all domestic cares did the situation of
his daughter oppress the Shastree. She was growing very beautiful;
in his eyes supremely so. So kind, too, so loving, so thoughtful, so
unselfish, so clever a scholar! She might have been a happy wife&mdash;ere
this, perhaps, a happy mother&mdash;yet at sixteen she was a widow,
with a gloomy future: not felt as yet; for the girl had grown up
with him, had shared in his studies, and had in all respects so entirely
enjoyed her young and peaceful life, that any thought of change had
never occurred to her.</p>

<p>She had been married at an early age, according to the custom of
her sect&mdash;when, indeed, she was little more than six years old&mdash;to
a youth, the son of a friend, who was one of the chief priests of the
temple of Punderpoor, a lucrative office, and one which would devolve
upon his son by hereditary right. The family was opulent,
and the young man gave promise of learning and of character. No
matter now; he was dead. Three years after the marriage he had
been cut off suddenly by a fever, to the grief of his family and to
the extinction of the Shastree's hopes for his daughter. Since then,
with no further worldly hope before her, Tara had betaken herself
to the study of the holy books in which her father delighted; and,
doomed as it were to a life of celibacy, had vowed it to the performance
of religious exercises after the manner of her faith.</p>

<p>It was unusual then, that Brahmun girls were taught to read
or write&mdash;more so than it is now; and in accordance with the rules
of the sect and the customs of the country, Tara, had her husband
lived, would ere now have joined him, and become mistress of his
household&mdash;a sufficient distinction for a Brahmun girl; but before
that event, the application of the child to such rudimental teaching
as her father had given her was so remarkable, that in process of
years the conventional rules of the caste had been set aside, and it
was a loving and grateful task to the father to lead his widowed
daughter through the difficult mazes of Sanscrit lore, and find in
hers an intellect and comprehension little short of his own.</p>

<p>Many of his friends shrugged their shoulders at this strange innovation
of ordinary custom, and argued astutely, that it was a dangerous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
thing to fill a girl's mind with learning. Others, his enemies, were
loud in their condemnation of the precedent it would afford to many,
and the bad uses it could be put to; and in disputes upon the subject,
texts were hurled at the Shastree by angry parties, to be answered,
however, by appeals to ancient times, as illustrated in holy books,
when women were deep scholars and emulated the men; and so
Tara's desultory education went on. "After all, what does it matter?"
said her father very frequently, if hard pressed by caste clamour;
"she does not belong to the world now: God has seen it good to cut
off her hopes: she has devoted herself to a religious life, and I am
teaching her and preparing her for it."</p>

<p>But this did not satisfy the adverse Pundits, still less the fact that
Tara as yet wore ordinary clothes, and her head as yet had not been
shaved. The degradation of Brahmun widowhood had not been
put on her; and she was too beautiful to escape notice, or the envious
comments of others, both male and female. The rites of widowhood
must be performed some time or other. Her father and mother both
knew that; they would have to take her to Punderpoor, or to
Benares, or to Nassuk, or other holy city, and after ceremonials of
purification, all that beautiful hair must be cut off and burned, the
pretty chaste bodice discarded, and she must be wrapped, ever after,
in a coarse white cotton&mdash;or silk&mdash;or woollen&mdash;sheet, and all other
dresses of every kind or colour be unknown to her.</p>

<p>Ah! it seemed cruel to disfigure that sweet face which they had
looked upon since she was a child, and had watched in all its growing
beauty! Any other less pure, less powerful parents, would long ago
have been obliged to comply with those cruel customs; and were
they not performed every day at the temple itself? "Why should
the rite be delayed?" said many; "the girl is too handsome; she
will be a scandal to the caste. The excuses of going to Benares, or
to Nassuk, are mere devices to gain time, and sinful." "The
matter must be noticed to the Shastree himself, and he must be
publicly urged and warned to remove the scandal from his house
and from the sect, which had been growing worse day by day for
the last three years."</p>

<p>Yes, it was true&mdash;quite true. Tara herself knew it to be true, and
often urged it. What had she before her but a dreary widowhood?
Why should she yet be as one who ostensibly lived in the world, and
yet did not belong to it? For whom was she to dress herself
and to braid her hair every day? For whom deck herself in jewels?
She did not remember her husband so as to regret his memory. She
had had no love for him. Married as a child, she had seen him but
a few times afterwards, when he came to perform needful annual
ceremonies in the house, and she had then looked up to him with
awe. He had rarely spoken to her, for she was still a child when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
he died. Once she remembered, when he was on a visit, her father
had made her recite Sanscrit verses to him, and read and expound
portions of the Bhugwat Geeta, and had said in joke that she would
be a better Pundit than he was.</p>

<p>She remembered this incident better than any other, and soon
after its occurrence he had died. Now she felt that, had he lived,
she might have loved him, and the reproach of widowhood would
not have belonged to her. These thoughts welled up often from
her heart with grief, and yearning only known to herself, and as
yet only half admitted: yet which increased sensibly with time, and
recurred, too, more frequently and painfully, as girls of her own
age, honoured wives and happy mothers&mdash;girls who had already taken
their places in life&mdash;met her at the temple with laughing crowing
children on their hips, proud of their young maternity: or came to
visit her, and spoke of domestic matters commonly&mdash;interests which
she could never create or enjoy, and yet for which the natural
yearning was ever present.</p>

<p>"Why did he go from me?" she would cry to herself, often with
low moaning; "why leave me alone? Why did they not make me
Sutee with him? Could I not even now be burned, and go to him?"
And if these thoughts changed, it was to the idea of a new wife for
her father, who, perhaps, would be as a sister. If a brother were
born, what a new source of pleasant care and occupation! Yet this
had its dark side also. "Would she be friendly to her and her
mother? and if not&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Her father and mother observed when gloomy thoughts beset her,
and when she became excitable and nervous in her manner, and they
did their best to cheer them away. "She might yet be happy in
doing charitable acts," they said, "in reading holy books, in meditation,
in pilgrimages; and they would go with her to Benares and
live there." "Why not," the Shastree would say; "why not, daughter?
We have but thee, and thou hast only us; it will be good to
live and die in the holy city."</p>

<p>Well, it sufficed for the time, and there were intervals when
people's tongues were quiet, and these were happy days because
so tranquil, and Tara had given herself and her destiny into her
father's hands.</p>

<p>"Do with me as thou wilt, O father," she said; "what is good
to thee is best for me; but do not risk anything of thy honoured
name for one so hopeless as I am. Why should I be a mockery
to myself? It may cost me a pang to part with all these;" and
she would pass her hand through those long, glossy, curling
tresses; "and ye too will grieve to see them gone, and your poor
Tara shaved and degraded; but there is no help for it, and the
honour of your house is more to your daughter than these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
ornaments. Without them I should be a comfort to ye, and at
peace with the world and with myself; with them, only a source
of disgrace and calumny, and I were better dead. Yes, let us go
to Benares, to Nassuk&mdash;anywhere&mdash;so that I leave my shame behind
me."</p>

<p>If that poor struggling heart were laid open, was there nothing in
its depths which, as she spoke it, combated this resolve fiercely and
unremittingly? If it had not been so, she would have been more
than human. There was the natural repugnant dread of this disfigurement
and disgrace. Worse, far worse, the endurance of the
after-life&mdash;the life of childless barren widowhood of which she knew
and saw daily sad examples. She knew of the bitter experience of
such widows, when all modest retirement, respect, and honour of
virgin or married life was discarded with the ceremonial rites, and
men's insult and women's contempt took their place: and that from
this there was no refuge till death.</p>

<p>When she shuddered at these truths&mdash;they were no delusions, and
her soul rebelled against them&mdash;some ideal being, mingling his life
with hers, caressing the beauty she was conscious of possessing,
would present himself in dreamy visions, waking or sleeping, and beset
her in terribly seductive contrasts. The very books she read offered
such to her imagination. There were no demigods now, no heroes
fighting for the glory of Hinduism, as related in the Ramayun; but
there were ideal examples of nobility&mdash;of bravery&mdash;of beauty, which
enthralled her fancy, and led it to portray to her realities. Yet there
was no reality, and could be none. She had not seen any one to
love, and never could see any one. Who would care for her&mdash;a
widow&mdash;who could love a widow? And yet the dreams came nevertheless,
and her poor heart suffered terribly in these contests with
its necessity. After all, it was more the calmness of despair than
conviction of higher motive which brought to her lips words such
as we have recorded:&mdash;"she would leave her shame behind her."</p>

<p>But her parents did not go, and the rites were deferred indefinitely.
Last year they were to have gone to Nassuk for the purpose to their
relatives; but the planets were not propitious, or the business of the
temple and its ceremonies interfered. This year, when the cold
season was nearly over, in the spring, at the Bussunt festival, if the
conjunctions were favourable, "they would see about it." They did
not get over the&mdash;"if."</p>

<p>So here were the two great cares of the household. Which was
the heaviest? To the Shastree, certainly, Tara's ceremony of widowhood.
His own marriage was a thing which concerned himself only,
and, at the worst, he could adopt an heir; but that Tara should be
a reproach to him, the revered Shastree and priest, and remain a
reproach among women&mdash;it could not be. The caste were becoming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
urgent, and the Gooroo, or spiritual prince, the "Shunkar Bhartee
Swâmi," whose agents travelled about enforcing discipline and reporting
moral and ceremonial transgressions, sent him word, privately
and kindly, that the matter should not be delayed. He
quite approved of the ceremony being performed at Benares or at
Nassuk, out of sight, for the old man knew Tara&mdash;knew her sad
history, and admired her learning and perseverance in study. At
his last visit, two years before, he had put up in the Shastree's
house, and had treated the girl as his daughter; but the requirements
of the caste were absolute, and were she his own daughter
he dared not to have hesitated.</p>

<p>But we have made a long digression.</p>

<p>"Come, daughter," said Anunda, "cast that sheet about thy head.
It strikes me that men look at thee too earnestly now as we pass the
bazaar, and the morning air is chill from the night rain."</p>

<p>"Nay, dear mother, not so. Am I a Toorki woman to veil my
face?" said Tara, quickly. "Am I ashamed of it? Art thou,
mother?"</p>

<p>"If thou wert not so beautiful, Tara. I dread men's evil eyes on
thee, my child, and I dread men's tongues more."</p>

<p>"Ah, mother! I dread neither," replied the girl. "They have
done me no harm as yet, and if my heart is pure and 'sutee' before
God and the Holy Mother, she will protect me. She has told me
so often, and I believe it. Come&mdash;I think&mdash;I think," she added,
with an excited manner, as she clasped her heavy gold zone about
her waist, her bosom heaving rapidly beneath the silken folds over
it, and her eyes glowing strangely, "I think, mother, she came to
me last night in my dream. She was very beautiful, O, very beautiful!
She took hold of my hair, and said,  'Serve me, Tara, I will
keep it for thee.'"</p>

<p>"Tara! art thou dreaming still?" exclaimed Anunda. "Holy
Mother! what light is in thine eyes? Put the thought far from
thee, O dearest; it is but the echo of what thy father said last night
when he comforted us both&mdash;it will pass away."</p>

<p>"Perhaps so, mother," answered the girl, abstractedly. "Yet it
seemed so real, I think I feel the touch on my hair still. I looked at
it when I rose, and combed it out, but I saw nothing. Yes, it will
pass away&mdash;everything passes away."</p>

<p>"And what was she like, Tara?" asked her mother, unable to
repress her curiosity.</p>

<p>"O mother, I was almost too dazzled to see. I am even now
dazzled, and if I shut my eyes the vision is there. There!" cried
the girl, closing her eyes and pointing forward, "there, as I saw it!
The features are the same; she is small, shining like silver, and her
eyes glowing, but not with red fire like those in the temple. O<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
mother, she is gone!" she continued, after a pause, "she is gone,
and I cannot describe her."</p>

<p>"Didst thou tell this to him&mdash;to thy father, Tara?" asked her
mother, much excited.</p>

<p>"Yes, mother. I awoke before him and could not sleep again. I
got up and drew water for him to bathe. I tended the fire, and sat
down to read. Then he went and bathed; and when he had come
out of the temple<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and put on dry clothes, I read part of the
'Geeta' to him, but I was trembling, and he thought I was cold.
Gradually I told him&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And what said he, daughter?" asked her mother, interrupting
her.</p>

<p>"He seemed troubled, mother, and yet glad, I could not say which.
He said he would ask 'the Mother' after the morning hymn was
ended."</p>

<p>"Come then, Tara, we will go to him at once. Nay, girl, as thou
art, thy words have given me strength, my pearl; come."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</a></h2>


<p>The Poorans relate that the goddess Doorga, Kalee, or Bhowani,
the wife of Siva, once slew a frightful giant named Muhésha, having
the head of a wild buffalo, to the great relief of the people who suffered
from its existence; and Hindus generally believe that this
event took place at Tooljapoor in the Dekhan. Toolja is another
name for Bhowani or Kalee, and hence Tooljapoor&mdash;the city of
Toolja. After the monster was slain, and the presence of the goddess
was no longer required on earth, she left the form she had
appeared in as witness of what had been done, changed it to stone,
and it was in after years discovered in the ravine where the monster
had been slain.</p>

<p>The image still remains where it is alleged to have been first
found, and where certain miraculous indications of its presence
were made. A temple was built over it, and a town gradually
gathered round the temple, which became famous throughout India,
and is frequented by pilgrims from all quarters. It is now the idol
worshipped there, and is a figure of black marble, or perhaps
basalt, highly polished, small, but of elegant proportions, with features
of the pure Hindu type. The eyes are composed of large
uncut rubies; and, as the image stands upon its altar, clothed
in a woman's garment, in the small dark sanctum of the temple,
they have always a strange, weird, and, to the worshippers, a fascinating
appearance, glittering through the gloom, and smoke of lamps
and incense always burning.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>
<p>The temple is a very picturesque object, from its situation in a
deep glen, the bottom of which is nearly filled by it. Pious worshippers,
and votaries from time to time, have enriched it by buildings
and courts surrounded by cloisters, ascending one above the other,
connected by flights of steps: and in these courts are several cisterns,
filled from springs in the sides of the hill. One of them,
peculiarly sacred, as believed to come from the Ganges, gushes from
a cow's mouth carved in the rock, and enters a large basin and
reservoir: and in all these cisterns pilgrims to the shrine, both male
and female, must bathe before they can worship the image. Crowded
by these pilgrims from all parts of India, of various colours and
physiognomies, languages and costumes, men and women,&mdash;bathing,
ascending or descending the broad flights of steps, pouring into the
lower courts in dense throngs, chanting mystic adorations, and singing
hymns in different languages and accents; it is impossible to
conceive a more picturesque or exciting scene than they present on
occasions of particular festivals, or, in general, on the day of the full
moon of every month.</p>

<p>The town of Tooljapoor adjoins the temple walls on three sides,
and ascends from them&mdash;the terraced houses clinging, as it were, to
ledges of the rugged glen&mdash;on the north and south. On the east,
the ascent is more regular; and the principal street slopes from the
crest of the tableland down to the first flight of steps leading to the
first court, and thence down successive flights of steps, through other
courts, to the lowest, which is the largest, and in which stands the
principal shrine, surrounded by cloisters and other buildings. Large
tamarind, peepul, and other trees, have grown accidentally among
the cliffs around, or have been planted in the courts, and have
flourished kindly, affording grateful shade; so the result, in the
mingling of foliage and buildings of many styles in the temple&mdash;surrounded
by the rugged sides of the ravine, occasionally precipitous:&mdash;and
the terraced houses, temples, and other buildings of the
town above them&mdash;is remarkably picturesque, and even beautiful.</p>

<p>The temple ravine opens into another of large dimensions, which,
in the form of an irregular semicircle, is perhaps a mile long by nearly
half of a mile at the broadest part of the diameter, narrowing to its
mouth. It is called the Ram Durra, and opens gradually beyond the
hills, upon one of the great undulating plains of the Dekhan. To
the north, the large ravine presents the appearance of an amphitheatre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
with precipitous sides, from which, in rainy weather, a number of
small but lofty cascades descend from the tableland above, and form
the head of a small river which eventually falls into the Bheema.</p>

<p>The hills which bound the ravine are about four hundred feet high,
and are, in fact, the edge of a very extensive plateau called the Bâlâ
Ghaut, which extends nearly a hundred miles, with only a slight
descent, towards the east; and, after ascending to the town of Tooljapoor
from the ravine, a flat plain is reached, on which the greater
portion of the town stands. One promontory of the entrance of the
great ravine juts out past and bounds the temple on the left or south
side, and along its face is the road by which the ascent is made from
the plain below. The hill then turns round sharp to the east, with
precipitous sides, leaving a level plain of a few hundred yards in
width between the town and the declivity.</p>

<p>On the edge of this precipitous side, to the south, are two other
temples, also holy. One, a tall octagon building, now covers the
rock on which the goddess is stated to have alighted from heaven
when she came to engage the monster who lived in the adjoining
ravine; and the other, a little further on, and much more ancient, is
situated at, and encloses the head of a spring which fills a cistern, as
it trickles down the precipice at all seasons of the year. This is also
a sacred place, and is called "Pâp-nâs," or "the sin destroyer;" and
the legend says that the goddess bathed in this spring, and washed
the monster's blood from her hands, after she had slain him; so it is
held sacred.</p>

<p>Truly the whole corner of the plateau is very beautiful. The
quaint old town hanging literally on the mountain edge: the deep
gloomy ravine of the temple opening out to the larger one: the
precipices and rugged hills to the west and north, and the beautiful
undulating plain to the south, over which the eye wanders as over
a map for fifty miles or more, checkered with thriving villages and
their rich fields and gardens,&mdash;form a striking assemblage of objects.
But the interest centres in the temple itself, with its gilded spires
and picturesque groups of buildings, as well as its strange effect in
the position in which it has been placed, attesting, no doubt, in the
opinion of the people&mdash;if there were any question on the subject,
the truth of the legend.</p>

<p>It will be understood from the foregoing, that the town is situated
considerably above the temple, and part of it on the level ground
of the plateau or plain. The Shastree's house was on the edge of
the crest of the ground, looking to the south over the ravine of
the temple, the cliffs, and a portion of the town beyond, across the
small plain which lay between the edge of the temple ravine and the
precipitous side of the mountain, and thence over the plain which,
in the far distance, mingled with the sky. To the south-east the line<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
of hills was rugged and broken, descending by steep spurs into the
lower plain; but from its edge, all round to the north, the eye followed
a fair, rich country, sloping eastwards, covered with grain-fields,
through which the small river Bóree, here only a brook, pursued a
quiet course among the town gardens. Again, to the north and west,
looking into and across the large wild ravine, were the precipices of
the Ram Durra, and the rugged basalt hills beyond them. So,
wherever you turned, it was a fair or wild scene alternately; and
standing upon the terrace of the Shastree's house, or sitting in a small
chamber which had been built over one of the corner rooms, you
could see all that has been told; and very beautiful it was.</p>

<p>The Shastree had travelled in his pilgrimages all over India. He
had seen wilder and grander scenes perhaps, but none pleasanter to
live in, than this cool, breezy, healthful mountain town, enhanced
by the presence of one of the holiest shrines in the country. Here
he must bear his misfortune calmly; and though his necessity urged
the change we have alluded to, he never issued from his door and
looked over the fair prospect about him, or performed the sacrificial
ceremonies at the temple, without being strengthened in his desire to
live and die here; and therefore the struggle in regard to his daughter
was the more bitter.</p>

<p>That morning he had risen unrefreshed&mdash;his sleep had been restless.
Something in one of the books he had been explaining to Tara in
the evening had brought up the subject of widowhood and its consequences
and obligations, and the message of his spiritual prince had
been discussed with much grief and misery to all. There seemed to
be no evasion of them possible&mdash;the rites must be fulfilled; and he
had again spoken of Benares, and Tara had simply and meekly
given herself into his hands, and prostrated herself before him and
her mother in submission. She was no doubt excited; and her first
communication in the morning startled him exceedingly.</p>

<p>You, O Christian reader! must not try his feelings by your own
standard. You live under a holier and simpler faith. If in the
ordinary occurrences of life, and its joys and sorrows, there is little
difference between you, it is very different in regard to faith. You
have but one object of calm, loving, trustful, humble adoration. He,
as all educated Hindus, believed in the same one God, but it was
overlaid by a gorgeous and picturesque mythology, and two distinctions
of&mdash;as he believed them to be&mdash;heavenly beings, to whom
separately and collectively worship was due, and yet whose interests
and designs were so different and apparently irreconcilable.</p>

<p>His household faith was for the most part a pure theism; but
circumstances arising out of hereditary rights had placed him at the
head of the local worship of the dread goddess, whom, either lovingly
or in deprecation of her possible wrath, he worshipped daily. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
the worship of Doorga or Bhowani, as the wife of the creating and
preserving power in her beneficence, and of the same power in her
destroying aspect&mdash;in her wrath terrible and unrelenting&mdash;is perhaps
more fascinating to women than to men; and, alternating with both
aspects, a woman, in all moods and in all necessities, may most
naturally perhaps apply to another woman, in whose power she
believes, for sympathy and assistance. Has it not ever been so?
Greek, Roman, Egyptian, Indian&mdash;nay, even Christian?</p>

<p>Nevertheless the Shastree believed, not lovingly perhaps, but in
deprecation of wrath; while his wife and daughter, unable to follow
the mystically subtle metaphysical creeds of the Véds and Shastras,
saw in their goddess enough to fill their hearts with practical faith
in, and reliance upon, her power over their destinies. To her, both
had addressed their vows and daily supplications, very simply and
earnestly, for this devotion of their lives to her was all they could
give, if their prayers were granted.</p>

<p>What wonder, then, that Tara's vision agitated him? The Shastree
knew of many women on whom the spirit of the goddess in
divine afflatus had descended. They were possessed by her: they
spoke and prophesied when they were full of her presence: and he
dreaded them while he worshipped the power displayed. As Tara
told him her dream, and the service the goddess had asked, could it
be real? Could his daughter, as an inspired priestess, ever speak
before the image? That, however, must be tried without delay,
and he hastened more rapidly than usual to the temple, having bid
her follow when her mother was ready.</p>

<p>He arrived as the ceremonies of bathing and dressing the image
were being performed by the inferior priesthood, and, these concluded,
the morning service began. We need not detail it&mdash;the decking of
the altar with flowers, the marking the forehead of the image with
the sacred colours, the offerings of daily food and sacred elements
with flowers, and the singing of mystic hymns. Vyas Shastree was
speedily joined by other Brahmuns and priests, and bare-headed,
naked to the waist, carrying the sacred fire and sacrificial offerings,
and chanting hymns with the accompaniment of clashing cymbals and
lutes. Thus the procession was passing round and round the temple,
and the simple but strange melody rising and falling amidst the buildings,
trees, and cliffs, and filling the ravine with sound, as Tara and
her mother gained the outer gate, and began to descend the steps
which led to the lower court.</p>

<p>Ordinarily they did not bathe in the sacred cistern where, from
the carved stone cow's mouth, the stream of the holy spring gushed
sparkling into the basin; but Tara paused as they passed it. She
had felt more and more excited as she neared the temple, and the
melody of the hymn and the clashing of the cymbals, as they came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
up together through the trees in the still air, had added to the
effect already produced in her mind by her dream.</p>

<p>"Mother," she said, hesitatingly&mdash;"mother, ought I not to bathe
here? Can I go into the presence, even with these garments on
me, after what the Holy Mother said last night? They should be
wet and pure."</p>

<p>"It is too cold for thee, my child," replied Anunda. "Come,
Tara, come on; the hymn will be finished ere we can join&mdash;come."</p>

<p>"No, mother, I am hot&mdash;burning; something urges me to the
well, and I cannot resist it. Mother, I must be pure before the
shrine. May I go?"</p>

<p>"The spirit of the goddess is with her, truly," thought her mother.
"Go, Tara, it may refresh thee," she said; "and there are dry
clothes in the temple. Go, be quick, my child!"</p>

<p>The girl descended the steps into the basin, and, turning to the
east, poured libations from her hands to the four quarters of the
earth; then the three libations to the sun, saying a short hymn from
the Véda. Then followed her prayer to the goddess. "Holy
Mother, do what thou wilt with me; take me, leave me, or use me
as thou wilt, but do not cast me away! Behold, I come!" Then
she stepped forth from the basin, her silk garment clinging to her
sweet form, and revealing its perfect proportions more than the
innate modesty of her mind permitted; hastily, therefore, she shook
it free from her limbs, while her mother wrung the water from the
ends.</p>

<p>"I am ready now," she said, simply; "come, mother, I will go
to her pure, and sit before her. If she wants Tara she will speak.
Come!"</p>

<p>Her mother had observed her glistening eye and glowing cheek,
which even the chill of the water did not subdue, and seeing the
expression of her face, as she ascended from the basin, was changed
from its habitual sadness to one of excited triumph, she caught the
infection herself, and seized Tara by the hand. "Come," she cried,
"Jey Kalee," "Victory to Kalee!" And so they descended the
steps more rapidly, while the music of the hymn and the clash of
the deep-toned cymbals resounded through the lower court, and
seemed to be echoed and repeated in the cliffs and buildings above
and around them.</p>

<p>The procession of Brahmuns and priests was turning the corner
of the temple as Tara and her mother met it in the full swell of the
music. Usually the girl and her mother fell in behind, reverentially
and calmly, and followed it as it passed round. Now, however, the
Shastree and his companions were amazed to see Tara separate herself
from her mother, and put herself at the head of the party, toss
her arms into the air, and join in the hymn they were singing&mdash;leading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
them on more rapidly than they had moved before. The
Shastree marked that she had bathed, and that her wet garments
dripped as she went along. "She is pure," he thought; "she has
prepared herself, and if the goddess will take her, it is her will.
There is something in this that cannot be stayed."</p>

<p>The other Brahmuns stopped, still chanting, and looked to Vyas
Shastree with wonder for some explanation, which was as quickly
given. "The goddess spoke to her last night, and will not be repelled,"
he said. "Go on, do not stop her; let her do as she lists."</p>

<p>No one dared stop her, or touch Tara. The height of excitement,
or, as they thought, inspiration, was in her eye, and that sweet face
was lifted up with a holy rapture. She seemed to fly rather than to
walk, so completely had her feelings carried her forward; and as
she moved she looked behind to those following, still chanting with
them, her arms waved above her head, and beckoning them onwards.
They could not resist the influence. So they passed on, round and
round the temple, still singing. Other morning worshippers, attracted
by the strange sight, joined them, or stood by wondering
till the hymn was finished. Then Tara, noticing no one, entered
the porch of the temple rapidly, and advancing alone, knelt down
before the door of the inner shrine in front of the image, and they
watched her silently.</p>

<p>What did she see to cause that earnest look? The image was
familiar to all. The light of the lamps within shone out strongly on
the kneeling figure, shrouded in its wet clinging drapery, but hardly
illuminated the gloomy space in the deep outer vestibule, around
which the spectators arranged themselves reverentially. The ruby
eyes of the goddess glittered with a weird brilliance from among
the cloud of incense burning before her; and the fragrant smoke,
issuing from the door, wreathed itself about her form and ascended
to the roof, and hung about the pillars of the room.</p>

<p>Those looking on almost expected the image would move, or speak,
in greeting or in reprehension of the young votary, and the silence
was becoming almost oppressive when the girl's lips moved: "Mother,"
she cried, in her low musical voice&mdash;"Mother! O Holy Mother!
Tara is here before thee. What wouldst thou of her?" And she
leant forward, swinging her body to and fro restlessly, and stretching
forth her hands. "Mother, take me or leave me, but do not cast
me away!" She could only repeat this simple prayer, for the yearning
at her heart could find no other words; but her bosom heaved
as though it would burst the bodice, and her hands and arms, with
her whole frame, trembled violently.</p>

<p>"She is possessed, brother," said another priest to her father.
"What hath come to her? When did this happen?"</p>

<p>"Peace," said the father, in a hoarse whisper; "disturb her not:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
let what will happen, even if she die. She is in hands more powerful
than ours, and we are helpless. O Tara, my child! my child!"</p>

<p>"Mother, dost thou hear? I will do thy bidding," again murmured
the girl. "Come, come! as thou wast in my dream. So come to
Tara! Ah, yes, she comes to me! Yes, Holy Mother, I am with thee;"
and, stretching forth her arms, she sank down on her face, shuddering.</p>

<p>"She is dying; my child! my pearl!" cried her mother, frantically,
who had been with difficulty restrained and who rushed forward.
"Will none of ye help?"</p>

<p>"Touch her not, Anunda," exclaimed her husband, holding her
back; "this brooks no interference. Let her lie and do as the Mother
would wish her; this will pass away." So they gathered round Tara
and watched her. She was tranquil now, not shuddering: the fair
round arms were stretched out towards the shrine, and the light
fell on the rippled glossy hair, which had escaped from the knot
behind, and hung over her face and neck, shrouding them in its
heavy waves.</p>

<p>"Let us chant the hymn to the praise of Doorga," said the old
Pundit who had before spoken; "brothers, this is no ordinary occurrence.
Many come and feign the divine afflatus, but there hath been
nothing so strange as this in my memory;" and, striking a few
chords on the vina he held in his hand, the hymn&mdash;a strange wild
cadence&mdash;was begun. The sound filled the vaulted chamber, and was
taken up by those outside, who crowded the entrance. Still she
moved not, but lay tranquilly; the full chorus of the men's voices
and the clashing of the cymbals were not apparently heeded by her.
As it died away, there was a faint movement of the arms, and
gradually she raised herself to her knees, tossed back the hair from
her face and neck, which fell over her shoulders and back, and
looked around her wildly for a moment; then, seeing her mother,
she leaned towards her as she advanced, and, stretching forth her
arms and clasping her knees, hid her face in her garment, and sobbed
convulsively.</p>

<p>"My child, I am here; I am with thee," said Anunda, supporting
her, and herself sobbing hysterically. "Speak! what is it? What
hast thou seen? My daughter, my sweet one, O speak to us!"</p>

<p>"Water, mother, water! my throat is parched! I cannot speak.
Is she gone?"</p>

<p>"Who, Tara?"</p>

<p>"The Holy Mother; she was with me&mdash;she entered into me.
O mother, what can I do? Where am I?"</p>

<p>"Here is water for thee, Tara; drink."</p>

<p>She tried to do so, but gasped at every attempt; at last she
swallowed a little, and was relieved. "She was not angry, mother,"
she said, smiling. "Did you not hear her speak? What did I
answer?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, my child," said her father; "thou wert silent, and we
feared the goddess had taken thy spirit; but thou livest, and we are
grateful."</p>

<p>Tara turned to her father with an imploring look for silence, and
again, but now calmly, prostrated herself before the image, while
the brilliant ruby eyes seemed, to those who beheld them, to glow
still more brightly through the smoke of the incense.</p>

<p>"Holy Mother of the gods," she said, in a low voice of prayer,
"I am thy slave. I fear thee no longer. Blessed Mother, I will love
thee, who art kind to Tara.... Here will I live and die with
thee according to thy word." Then she arose and continued to him:
"Come, father; behold, I am calm now."</p>

<p>"She is accepted, brethren," said the old priest, turning to the
others; "let us do her honour. With no life for the world, let her
widowhood remain in the Mother's keeping: she has chosen her, let
no man gainsay it. Come, daughter, let me mark thee as she would
have it done;" and, entering the shrine, he took several of the garlands
from the neck of the image, and a small vessel containing
water in which were the leaves of the sacred Toolsee; dipping his
finger into which, he marked her gently on the forehead, sprinkling
some on her head, on which he placed his hands as he said the
incantation which denoted the presence of the divinity. Then he
hung the garlands about her neck, and the fragrant red powder of
the morning sacrifice being handed to him, he drew some gently
across her forehead and bade her stand up.</p>

<p>"Jey Toolja!" "Victory to Toolja!" was shouted by the attendant
priests and worshippers. "Victory to the Holy Mother!"
"Victory to her votary!" "Let us take her in procession!" "Let
us go with her!" cried all around.</p>

<p>"Ah, no, friends," said the girl, rising modestly; "ye see but a
poor helpless child who was in grief, and whom the Mother has comforted.
Leave me! let me go! I would go home. Mother, take
me away! Father, do thou come with me!"</p>

<p>"It may not be, daughter," said the old priest, kindly; "we must
neglect nothing, else it were dangerous for thee and for us. Bring
a palkee," he shouted to the attendant priests, "and get the music
ready, and flowers too, and offerings for the Pâp-nâs. Yes, brother,"
he continued to her father, "for once I usurp thy office; thou
knowest what is needed. Come, let us not delay."</p>

<p>Tara looked imploringly at her father; she would fain have
escaped the public procession if she could. She only wanted now to
get home unperceived, and to hide herself in her chamber. What
had she done to be so honoured&mdash;to be so noticed?</p>

<p>"It must be, my child," he said; "this cannot be begun and
abandoned; let not thy heart fail thee, the Holy Mother will be with
thee. Come!"</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>Tara yielded: she bent reverently before the old priest, and touched
his feet, then her father's, and going round the Brahmuns assembled
she did the same; last of all her mother's, who was sobbing, yet not
in sorrow. "Come," she said, "I am ready; do with me as ye list.
Ye are my elders, and I obey."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</a></h2>


<p>So they led Tara forth and placed her in the open palankeen, and, as
they decked her with flowers, and strewed garlands over its canopy,
the temple music struck up a joyous marriage measure. Then, as
the bearers moved gently forward, her father and mother holding the
sides of the litter, the priests arranged themselves on all sides of it,
and began another solemn chant of victory to the goddess.</p>

<p>By this time, news of the event had passed on into the town, and
it was the hour when all the people were astir. Men and women,
collected in groups, heard strange tales of how the goddess had appeared
to Tara and taken her away to heaven; again, that she had
died before the shrine, and they were bringing away her body. The
general conviction was, that she had died, and many women, collected
in knots, were weeping bitterly and beating their breasts. But as
the temple trumpets and conchs blew a sudden and quivering blast,
and the glad music was heard with the chant, now rising, now falling,
as the procession slowly ascended the steps, and traversed the court,&mdash;and
at last, as it emerged from the gateway and entered the broad
street which led to the centre of the town,&mdash;the popular enthusiasm
knew no bounds. "Jey Toolja!" "Jey Kalee!" "Bome! Bome!"
the cries of victory&mdash;were taken up from those who led the procession,
leaping and shouting. Many ran for incense or for garlands:
men and women thronged from street and alley and joined the procession
as it moved up; others stood upon the terraces of their houses
and waved garments or handkerchiefs, or hung out cloths from the
balconies and windows. "Jey Toolja!" "Jey Bhowani!" shouted
all who came. Pilgrims from the Ganges, Sunniasis holding aloft
their withered arms; Gosaees with their orange clothes and matted
locks, strange, wild, eerie folk,&mdash;issued from archways where they
had slept, or vaults where they had lodged; and still the crowd
swelled, and the shouting, and through all, and over all, the solemn
chant and the hoarse and shrill quivering notes of the trumpets.</p>

<p>Few knew why this was, but the procession advanced out of the
temple gate, so it belonged to it; and as the girl passed, seated calmly
now in her litter, flowers were cast on her, incense was burned
before her, and fragrant powder thrown over her, with blessings.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
Her old friends, the flower-sellers, emptied their morning baskets of
jessamine over her, and touched her feet reverentially; and the old
confectioner, who had always kept a sweet morsel for his young
friend, threw showers of comfits upon her litter, and in his excitement
generously flung the contents of his baskets among the crowd.</p>

<p>So they passed on, through the eastern gate, and over the plain
which led to the Pâp-nâs temple, and the sun was now rising over
the distant purple hills in great glory among gorgeous golden clouds.
As the first beams fell upon the procession, the priests changed their
hymn to that in adoration of the Sun, from the Védas, which we
adopt from a free translation:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
"Risen in majestic blaze,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Lo, the Universe's eye,</span><br />
Vast and wondrous host of rays,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Shineth brightly in the sky.</span><br />
<br />
"See, he followeth the Dawn,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Brilliant in the path above,</span><br />
As a youth by beauty drawn<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Seeks the maiden of his love.</span><br />
<br />
"Hear us, O ye gods, this day!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Hear us graciously, we pray;</span><br />
As the Sun his state begins,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Free us from all heinous sins.</span><br />
<br />
"Mitra, Varun, Aditi&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Hear, O hear us graciously!</span><br />
Powers of Ocean, Earth, and Air,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Listen, listen, to our prayer."<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></span><br />
</div>

<p>And the people still shouted the cry of the goddess, or joined in the
hymn of the priests, till the small temple was reached.</p>

<p>The ceremonies there were brief and simple. Tara bathed in the
sin-cleansing basin, but she would not change her wet garments, still
resisting her mother. Once more were holy texts and incantations
said over her by all the priests collectively; and for the last time they
led her round and round the little shrine and court of the spring,
chanting a hymn of praise; her father leading, but submitting to the
old priest who has already been mentioned. It was finished, and
her new life began. The excitement which had possessed her and
carried her on was already passing away, and giving place to a sick
weariness and irrepressible languor, which not only her face but her
limbs expressed.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>
<p>"She will need careful tending for a long time, brother," said the
old priest to her father. "Give her a cooling drink of toolsee and
tamarinds, sweetened with honey; put her into dry clothes, and let
her rest quietly; she may not even speak for many days; for so I
have known it. Let us take her home."</p>

<p>"I am thankful to ye all, friends and brethren," said the Shastree,
much affected. "This manifestation hath filled me with many cares,
for we were not votaries of the goddess. Now she hath come into the
house, and the service she exacts is rigid, yet we will obey and do
her will. If ye will depart and leave us, take my blessing."</p>

<p>"Nay, say not so," cried all who were near. "Let us take her
home; and in honour and duty let this rite be finished." So the procession
was again formed, and in the same order that it had reached
the temple, it again returned to the town-gate, and wound through
the streets, thronged with curious gazers, to the door of the Shastree's
dwelling, where the priest and Brahmuns were dismissed with thanks
and those only remained who were specially bidden to do so.</p>

<p>Tara's exhaustion had been increasing since the ceremony was concluded;
and the wet garments about her, which had not been felt
while the excitement lasted, now struck a chill into her which even
dry clothes, cast over her by her mother, did not remove. She could
not speak, and could hardly move from the litter as it was set down;
and when, supported by her mother and the servants, she reached
the inner apartment, she sank helplessly in her mother's arms. But
she was now in gentle, careful hands, and at rest; and though she
did not speak as yet, her grateful looks ere long expressed all the
consciousness her mother longed to see.</p>

<p>She had ever after only a confused recollection of what had occurred;
and even as they came home there was a vacancy in her
look which had seriously alarmed her parents. Her father could
remember many such votaries, in whom the light of reason had been
utterly quenched, and he trembled for his daughter. We can account
for the occurrence by rational causes: a long-continued mental excitement
and suppressed care brought on by the nature of her own
belief in, to her, that goddess of dread power, yet of sympathy with
human requirements,&mdash;and its hysterical effect; but to her father,
and more so to her mother, as also to all the priests of the temple and
people of the town, it was a manifestation of the divine interest, and
a claiming of the girl for her own peculiar service.</p>

<p>We will not follow the conference between the Shastree and his
friends, which related to ceremonies to be performed and sacrifices
to be offered: nothing must be neglected. One of them was the
resident agent of the spiritual prince before alluded to, who had only
a few days before delivered the friendly warning, now unneeded.
"The Mother hath settled this matter herself, friends," he said,
"and no one can resist it; we will write collectively to the 'Swâmi,'
and tell him of it; he, too, will be assured that this divine favour is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
the result of Vyas Shastree's piety, and his daughter's devotion to
religious rites; better this than worldly allurements and ties, sweet as
they are."</p>

<p>There was no dissentient voice. Nor in the town, nor among the
caste, could any one impugn the act. It had been involuntary and
public. Thousands had witnessed it, and they bore testimony of the
holy fervour which had animated all who accompanied Tara from the
temple. All seemed to have caught a portion of the divine manifestation
and enthusiasm.</p>

<p>So every one said that the beautiful daughter of Vyas Shastree
had become a Moorlee or priestess of the temple, and that the goddess
herself had called her from her disgrace of widowhood to the glory
of her own service. Was not this better than worldly ties? Now
she was free!</p>

<p>Did Tara think so? It was many weeks ere the feverish excitement
passed away, during which the loving eyes glowed with unnatural
lustre, and a fierce fire seemed to possess her. It was to be expected;
and she had skilful and tender attendance. With perfect rest and
quiet, and simple remedies, it would pass away, they said, and it did
so gradually, and Tara arose weaker, but calm. By-and-by she would
be allowed to make her sacrificial offerings, but not yet; and till
then her beloved books, the household worship, and occupation, were
enough to occupy her.</p>

<p>"Time enough," said the old Pundit, who frequently visited her
and had become interested in her, "with a life of service to be done.
When you are strong you shall come to us, but not till then."</p>

<p>Was Tara satisfied? If the dread of her shame had been removed,
the void in her heart had not as yet been filled; but the new life had
to begin, and she would do her best, and so she comforted herself.</p>

<p>Were others satisfied? Yes. As we have said, most who knew her
envied her lot, but some sneered, and already shook their heads.</p>

<p>One man had looked at the distraught girl, as she was placed in
the litter and covered with garlands, who was satisfied, yet not as the
rest. More beautiful in the unconsciousness of her excitement than
he had ever seen her before,&mdash;far more so, to his sight, than she had
ever appeared while ordinarily attending the temple worship with
her mother, and where he had watched her for months past, Moro
Trimmul had joined the throng in order to observe her better.
Being a Brahmun, he had closed up to the edge of the litter bare-headed
and unnoticed, singing the hymns as one of the attendant
priests, and had thus been able to accompany the procession, gloating
upon the girl's loveliness with an unholy desire. As the litter was
taken up he fell out of the procession, and, watching it depart, sat
down alone on the edge of the cliff looking over the plain, and by
the side of the small stream which, issuing from the Pâp-nâs temple,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
fell down the face of the rock in a sheet of foam. A girl's voice
aroused him from a reverie which we dare not follow.</p>

<p>"So the Pundit is not dancing back to the town as he came out,
before the new Moorlee," she said ironically.</p>

<p>"Nor thou either, Gunga. Dost thou not welcome a new
priestess?"</p>

<p>"I marvel at it," she continued, with a sneer; "thou wast looking
enough at her. I dance before her? When she dances with us
before the Mother, then she will be a true Moorlee&mdash;not else. Now
I hate her; I shall always hate her."</p>

<p>"Ah! she will never join ye," he returned; "she is of another sort
than the rest of ye: Gunga, thou art jealous of her beauty, girl."</p>

<p>"By the Holy Mother, she shall not remain so, Moro Trimmul.
She&mdash;a widow&mdash;to think of setting herself above us! That cat-faced
girl! If she has chosen to serve the Mother she must obey her rules,
and be one of us. Think ye we will let her come there unless she
is?"</p>

<p>The Brahmun shook his head. "I was thinking about her," he
said, absently.</p>

<p>The girl sighed. "I thought so," she replied, "and thou wilt love
me no more&mdash;no more now. Is it not so? say it, if it is to be so."</p>

<p>"Love thee!" returned the man, bitterly&mdash;"yes, as thou canst be
loved&mdash;by gold. Hark ye, Gunga, make her as thou art; get her
into my power, and I will give thee a waist-belt of gold."</p>

<p>"As heavy as hers?" cried the girl, excitedly.</p>

<p>"Thou shalt weigh the one against the other and thine shalt turn
the scale&mdash;will that content thee?"</p>

<p>"Wilt thou?&mdash;shall it? Swear on my neck and my feet to give
this, and I will do thy will. Yes, to humble her pride and her
father's&mdash;who drove me from the temple one day, and I have hated
him ever since. I shall hate thee too, afterwards; yet I will do it,"
cried the girl, excitedly, clapping her hands&mdash;"yet I will do it."</p>

<p>"I swear," said the man, touching her neck. "Come and sit here
by me." She did so, but neither spoke for some time.</p>

<p>"Thou hast a sister, Moro Pundit, and she is beautiful. She
ought to have been married ere this. A little more time, and can it
be done?" she said, breaking the silence.</p>

<p>The Brahmun winced. "She was betrothed once," he said, "but
the man died."</p>

<p>"Perhaps she was married," continued the girl, with a sneer, "and
she is as Tara Bye, or worse. Is it not so?"</p>

<p>"No! by the Holy Mother, no!" cried the Pundit, sharply, and
with flashing eyes. "Breathe such a thing and I will have thy life.
Beware what thou sayest, even to me! A word more, and I fling
thee down the precipice!"</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>"O, I fear not for my life," said the girl, carelessly, "the Mother
takes care of that, and I will say nothing, lest I should lose my
pretty gold zone. But what of thy sister? The Shastree wants a
new wife, we hear; Anunda Bye wants a son to cheer her and him,
and why should not thy sister be taken there? If I do not err, she
can have her chance. She is of a good age&mdash;why not? Could she
understand what to do? Could she be taught?"</p>

<p>"Ah!" said the Pundit, abstractedly, "I had thought of it too, but
it seemed impossible. I do not know him&mdash;yes&mdash;if&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If?&mdash;why if? Art thou afraid? The girl is here&mdash;let me see
her and know her, and leave the rest to us."</p>

<p>"Gunga," said the Brahmun, after a pause. "If thou canst
bring this about&mdash;if thou canst get me speech of this Shastree&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Let me speak to the girl first. 'Radha,' that is her name, is it
not? Let me see if she is resolute and as I hear of her. If she be,
she shall have her desire; thou shalt have thine; and I&mdash;ah, yes! I
will have more gold. Yes," she cried, clapping her hands again,
"more gold! I will have gold anklets, like Tara's. Why should
she wear gold anklets and mine be only silver? Wilt thou give
them?&mdash;all I can hope, now she hath taken thy love from me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"When my sister is Vyas Shastree's wife thou mayst have what
thou wilt, Gunga. I swear it to thee on thy neck and feet. Art
thou content? Yes, thou shalt see her now. Manage the matter as
ye will, women's wits are sharper than mine. Now follow me unobserved,"
he said, rising.</p>

<p>"Once more, Moro Pundit," continued Gunga, "tell me if the
marriage can be performed now? Is there a fitting conjunction of
planets?&mdash;within a month?"</p>

<p>"Yes; till the Now Râtree; after that not for a long time."</p>

<p>"Enough to do, enough to do, in the time," muttered the girl to
herself. "Hast thou any women with thee&mdash;any relations?"</p>

<p>"Yes, her mother's sister&mdash;a widow; no more. Our mother is
dead, my father is dead, and there are only ourselves left of a large
family."</p>

<p>"Then the Shastree will like the connection all the better, and&mdash;ye
are rich, they say. Yes, I will bring the widow and Anunda together."</p>

<p>"We have enough. In that respect I can satisfy the Shastree fully."</p>

<p>"Ah! he will ask no questions. His wife is shrewd and clever,
and will guide him," she replied; "but he will be careful about the
horoscope of thy sister, for he is a great astrologer."</p>

<p>"My aunt is wise, as you will find when you know her; and
as for the rest, Gunga, it is in my hands. I, too, am an astrologer
and can cast Radha's nativity as I please."</p>

<p>The girl laughed heartily. "Yes, it will answer," she said. "Now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
go by that path; we must not be seen together. I will come to thee
before noon; we have no time to lose. Only remember thine oath,
Moro Trimmul, and beware how thou triest to evade or deceive me.
I would not hurt thee willingly; and for the sake of&mdash;&mdash;. No matter
now," she continued, gulping down what was rising in her throat,
"no matter now. It is gone&mdash;I see no more of it in thine eyes."</p>

<p>"I am in thy hands, Gunga, and may be trusted," he replied; "nay,
more, there may be better days for thee yet, girl&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no more. No more like the old ones," she said, shaking
her head mournfully. "Only the gold now&mdash;only the gold!"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</a></h2>


<p>"Yes, surely it is strange that the two nativities should fit so
exactly," said Vyas Shastree to himself, some days after the events
recorded in the last chapter, as, seated by himself upon his dais,
and having given orders not to be disturbed, he appeared absorbed
in a table of nativity which lay before him; "yes, it is strange indeed.
The date of birth, the signs under which she was born, and the few
calculations which have been made by a master hand, all agree, as
they ought to do; and the result, as I have worked it out, is clear
enough. This girl, born at Wye, an utter stranger to me hitherto,
and brought here by a chance pilgrimage, is proposed for me; and
Anunda, Tara, and the old Josee will have it so. Yes, it is a curious
coincidence indeed; but let me test these formulæ again; there may
be error."</p>

<p>While the Shastree is busy with some curiously abstruse calculations
upon his own and the other horoscope he is considering, we
must digress a little, to show by what steps Gunga's plans, roughly
shadowed out to Moro Trimmul, as we have recorded, were apparently
fast approaching a satisfactory completion.</p>

<p>Negotiations had been satisfactorily opened by Anunda with Sukya
Bye, the aunt of Moro Trimmul. This lady had, indeed, already
become a great favourite with Anunda and Tara, and she had been
guided in her intercourse with them by the directions of Gunga.
Eventually, the question of marriage, or otherwise, having passed
the ladies favourably, rested with the Shastree himself.</p>

<p>The contrivances by which this result had been brought about were
apparently too simple to cause suspicion. Yet they had been produced
by carefully designed arrangement. It was first of all necessary to
get Sukya Bye and Anunda acquainted, and this was brought about
at the temple on the night of the ceremonies of the last full moon.
The wife of the chief priest had the power to render the performance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
of the necessary worship convenient to any one she pleased.
She could direct special attendance by assistant priests on her
friends, and could reserve seats for them, on which they could see
and hear to the best advantage. So as Sukya Bye, whose figure
and dress bespoke her rank and respectability, was apparently vainly
endeavouring to reach the shrine to make her offerings with other
women,&mdash;Gunga, seeing her hustled and pushed about, assisted her
as far as possible; and, feigning to be unable to do more, appealed
to Anunda, who had herself noticed the old lady's struggles, for
assistance to her.</p>

<p>Sukya Bye was one with whom it was no degradation to be seen associating.
Her tall figure, dressed in the richest of plain silk garments,
and the heavy gold rings she wore round her arms, wrists, and
ankles, betokened wealth, as did her shaved head that she was a
widow; and the stout Mahratta serving-men, who, armed with sword
and buckler, attended her, proved that she was of some rank, certainly
of very respectable position.</p>

<p>Gunga had left her under Anunda's care, and ere the ceremony
was concluded the ladies had become excellent friends. It will be
remembered that Anunda herself was from the western provinces of
the Dekhan, and the dialect and intonation of the lady Sukya sounded
pleasantly in her ears. Questions were asked, some mutual acquaintances
discovered, and a visit by Anunda soon followed.</p>

<p>Moro Trimmul, his aunt, and sister, lived or lodged but a short distance
from the Shastree, and it soon came to pass that the ladies
visited each other frequently. Sukya had a point to gain, so had her
niece Radha, and both worked in concert with the girl Gunga, to
whom whatever happened was related. Her fresh instructions from
day to day guided them perfectly, not only to gaining the good will
of mother and daughter, but of establishing a more affectionate interest
in their concerns than would otherwise have arisen out of a
common acquaintance.</p>

<p>Sukya, proud of her own birth and connections, found Anunda
perfectly in accord with herself on that subject. She saw the wealth
and comfort of the house, she led Anunda to detail their domestic
cares, and offered her sympathy, which was accepted. "Ah, yes, if
the Shastree would only marry again!" said Anunda to her in confidence,
"and there should be a son born, they would take him to
Benares and devote him to Siva. They had wealth; yet without
this it was a weight and a care to them, which increased rather
than diminished."</p>

<p>During these visits of confidence between the elders, Tara and
Radha had their own pleasant time too, and Tara's trustful nature was
easily won by the other. Radha was ignorant, it was true, but she
was to all appearance open-hearted and simple, and she soon learned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
to feign that reverential yet intimate association with the beautiful
widow and her mother, which Gunga counselled, and which was
indeed necessary to the success of the whole scheme.</p>

<p>For some days Anunda made no communication to Sukya Bye of
the subject nearest her heart; but as she saw the intimacy of the
two girls increase, and that the intercourse had served to turn Tara's
thoughts into new channels, and also that she herself, as she gradually
gained strength, always found some pretext for a daily visit to
her young friend, the thought gradually pressed the more upon her
mind, that here was a connection which was most desirable for her
husband; and, finally, the question alone remained, whether Radha's
family would consent.</p>

<p>Tara had no objection either. Indeed, from the first sight of Radha's
present extreme beauty, and promise of its development&mdash;from her
respectful, nay reverential, demeanour to her mother, and her apparently
loving trustfulness of herself&mdash;she, too, began to think that
a better selection could not be made, if her father were willing to
take a second wife, than this girl. So she grew to wish it.</p>

<p>Therefore, with much exhortation to privacy, and in the fullest
assurance of confidence, Anunda had ventured to ask Sukya Bye,
after all reserve had been broken down, whether the alliance might be
hoped for. She dwelt at length upon her husband's accomplishments
and his wealth. He was not old; many men married far beyond
his age. Money was no object&mdash;it could be paid if necessary; and
she herself would be as a mother, and Tara a sister, to the new wife.
In short, Anunda opened her whole heart to her new friend, and in
the end found the sympathy she had expected. Yes, the more Sukya
Bye considered the matter, the more, as she told Anunda, was she
convinced it would be an admirable arrangement. Radha had once
been betrothed as a mere child; the person had died lately, else
they were to have been married this year. Delay had occurred because
the intended husband was poor. He had not sufficient to pay
the expenses of the ceremonies. Then Radha's father had died, then
her mother, when Moro Trimmul was as yet a youth. He had made
no provision for his sister. How could he? So she remained unmarried.
Another connection must have been sought for this year,
and Anunda's proposal was admirably timed.</p>

<p>Now, all this was true enough in some respects, but not entirely.
It was enough, however, for two persons to believe, whose affections
were already enlisted in the progress of the matter; and such inquiries
as they could make from people who knew Wye, confirmed
what had been told them by their new acquaintance. Was the girl
herself willing? Apparently she was. And she received, with all
the bashfulness and interest necessary to the occasion, the proposal
made to her by Tara on the part of her mother. Anunda had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
had her fears on this subject, lest the young and beautiful girl
should refuse to ratify what her aunt had proposed; but beyond
a natural shyness there seemed no objection.</p>

<p>One doubt only remained,&mdash;were the horoscopes of the parties in
good accordance? "Moro Trimmul," Sukya Bye said, "would never
consent to give his sister where the planets did not provide good fortune&mdash;in
short, till he was satisfied there was no ceremonial objection
or direct hindrance. And before the proposition was made to
the Shastree&mdash;before, in short, the men were to discuss the proposed
arrangement, Moro Trimmul wished to see the Shastree's horoscope,
in order that the last point of doubt should be removed." He also
would give his sister's to the Shastree, if the proposal were to be persevered
in.</p>

<p>Very unsuspectingly, therefore, did Anunda take the scheme of
her husband's nativity, his "Junum Putr," from the casket in which
it was kept, and, with many injunctions as to its safety, gave it to
Sukya Bye. It was not long detained; and she was gratified by
hearing that the Josee, seated in an adjoining apartment, considered it
a most happy one. "Might he copy a few portions? they had been
so admirably calculated." And the dame had no objection.</p>

<p>Certainly the plan had been well laid, and as yet well executed.
No very deep persuasions were necessary with these simple unsuspecting
people. The mother and daughter had yielded long ago;
and the result of the examination of the Shastree's Junum Putr
had removed the last obstacle which concerned him. The matter, as
arranged, should be broken to him that evening on his return from
the temple. And the lady Sukya suggested that he should examine
her niece's horoscope as corroborative of his own.</p>

<p>So Moro Trimmul had that day put the finishing touch to his
work. He had been concealed when the lady Anunda brought the
paper we have mentioned; he had rapidly copied the principal points
in the table, and noted all the most remarkable of the latter indications
exhibited; and he knew that, before evening, he could prepare
a corresponding document regarding his sister, which the Shastree
himself could not detect. This was a branch of science which Moro
Trimmul had studied deeply; and it was with perfect confidence that
he followed the astrological combinations relating to the Shastree,
and constructed, yet not with too minute detail, the table in his
sister's name.</p>

<p>Few Hindu parents care to have the Junum Putr, or "birth letter,"
of their daughters worked out; but after Moro Trimmul had cast
the table itself on an imaginary date of birth, two years later than
the real age of his sister, and as if it had been done carelessly and
then abandoned, he followed up several of the formulæ indicated,
leaving the last incomplete. He felt assured, therefore, when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
paper was submitted to the Shastree, that he would himself carry
out the last calculation, which had been so arranged as to lead to
the present time, and to a combination with his own.</p>

<p>All had been finished. The paper on which it was written was
new, but it was not paper of that part of the country; it was from
his own district. An ornamental border was quickly drawn round
it, in red, black, and yellow lines; the signatures of the witnesses
to his sister's original and true Junum Putr were carefully copied;
finally, the whole document was held over wood-smoke till it was
of a proper brown colour, then rubbed and frayed at the edges, and
creased here and there as if it had been often examined; and, lastly,
it was perfumed with camphor to remove the smell of wood-smoke,
and with the odour of benzoin and sweet pastille. No one, without
much difficulty, could have detected the forgery; and, without suspicion,
the Shastree had set himself to work out the problem left
unfinished&mdash;the occupation which we have already noted.</p>

<p>On leaving their friends, after this early visit, in which the Junum
Putr was taken, Anunda and Tara had determined to lose no further
time in breaking the matter to the Shastree. It was a fortunate day,
as they had been told by the old astrologer, the Shastree's friend,
whom they had consulted as they went home; whatever they did was
sure to prosper. The Shastree was in good humour with himself,
with them, and with the world generally, and for many reasons.
His greatest care about Tara had been removed. She had been accepted
as a votary of the goddess, and had already recovered from
her excitement. He had written with others a joint petition to the
"Swâmi" on the subject, and she had been duly recognized by her
spiritual prince. No fear of reproach now existed; and if the Shastree
had at first winced at the idea of his daughter becoming a
Moorlee, a public votary at the temple, the feeling was passing away.
The gods forbid she should become as other girls, who were devoted
to the temple service! No; she desired to be pure, and should
continue so.</p>

<p>The long and expensive journey to Nassuk, or worse, to Benares,
had been saved, and half a year's rent had just come in from his
estate. The crops were fine; there were no remissions needed; prices
were high, and the rent had been punctually paid. The produce of
the gardens and farms was also good this year, and the fees and
dues from pilgrims were abundant. This was a special year for
pilgrimages to the shrine, and full moon after full moon the crowd
would increase.</p>

<p>"What are we to do with it all?" Anunda would ask, as day
after day the bag containing the Shastree's dues was brought from
the temple by the attendant clerk, or as her husband gave over to
her the liberal gifts presented to him by wealthy visitors to the
shrine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>As she asked this question of him, the Shastree laughed, and told
her it must increase, for the Now Râtree, or nine nights of the goddess,
then coming on, were attended by a wonderful conjunction of
planets foreboding marvellous events, and which could not indeed
occur again in many years&mdash;indeed, not under less than a cycle.
There would be thousands upon thousands of worshippers there, and
the gain would be enormous. What, indeed, were they to do with
it all? "We must spend it upon poor Brahmuns, dig wells in desert
places, and give marriage portions&mdash;all good works, and pleasing to
the gods: what have Brahmuns to do with wealth?" said the
Shastree.</p>

<p>"Nay; but we will have a marriage at home," thought Anunda;
and from the time the alliance was shaped into form she began to
hoard every rupee she could get. Never had the gardeners found her
so active in coming down to Sindphul to look after the fruit and
vegetables in the garden there. Never had the sellers in the Bazar
known her to be so keen after the returns of sale. As she said to
herself, if there is a marriage, my lord shall have a good one.</p>

<p>This very plethora of wealth brought about the question with her
husband. "What can we do with it?" he said one day, on receiving
an unusually large gift.</p>

<p>"We will marry you," said the wife. "Tara and I have determined
upon it in our own minds; and oh, my dear honoured husband, you
are not to object! We have kept this from you as yet; but if you
will agree, we have found a treasure, a jewel, such as we can give
to you, and be proud and thankful to see you wear."</p>

<p>There was no circumlocution in the matter. Anunda, watching
her opportunity, as a wife best knows how to do, had gone direct to
the point, and, seconded by Tara, had smoothed away all difficulties
and won the victory.</p>

<p>The Shastree made but one condition&mdash;that which Moro Trimmul
had expected, and for which he had provided. "I care not for
wealth or for beauty," he said to his wife. "We are rich&mdash;too rich;
and thou, Anunda, art more beautiful than ever; but the 'birth
letter' must accord; and she must be pure and high in blood."</p>

<p>So Anunda had told him that, as to the first, she would ask for the
"birth letter," and hope it would be good; as to the second, what
doubt at all? She could vouch for good birth, as good as their
own, and for wealth if that were needed.</p>

<p>Now, therefore, that the matter all hinged upon the fitness or
otherwise of Radha's "birth letter," and the last link in Anunda's
chain was to be completed or for ever broken, it may be conceived that
she awaited her husband's decision on the subject with much anxiety.
He had requested not to be disturbed while he made the examination.
So Anunda and Tara waited within. The outer door of the court<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
had been fastened as well as that of the school, and he was, as we
found him at the beginning of this chapter, alone on his dais, absorbed
in the contents of the document before him.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said again aloud, "that it is strangely coincident, there
can be no doubt. Again and again I have checked these formulæ,
and they are right, and the abandoned calculation leads direct into
my own. Ho, Tara! Anunda!" he cried, "bring my Junum Putr,
quick; I need it." And Anunda took it, and, laying it before him,
did not venture to stay or to speak; but she saw by the expression
of his face that he was deeply interested, and she again withdrew.</p>

<p>He opened it, that strange shadowing of his life which, with a
fascination he could not resist, he had occasionally examined, yet
without daring to pry into the future. Enough that he could follow
the past as nearly as might be from the fallible nature of the science.
Now, he laid both papers together; and his eye passed from one to
another rapidly, as his chest heaved and his pulses throbbed with
an excitement to which he had long been a stranger, forcing from
him the exclamations of wonder which we have recorded.</p>

<p>"Marvellous and mysterious agents in our existence," he continued,
"who can withstand ye? who can refuse your directions? Here I
bow before ye, O mystic fates, lead me as ye will; this happiness,
aided by these heavenly indications, I dare not resist. Anunda!
Tara! O wife! O child!" he continued as they entered, stretching
out his hands towards them, "be it as ye will, beloved!"</p>

<p>That was a happy evening for the three. It was not too late to
ratify the act, and then the preparations were soon made. A few
lumps of sugar-candy and some spices were placed on a silver salver,
and garlands of fresh flowers procured from the flower-sellers.
Anunda dressed herself in one of her best suits, and Tara put on a
simple new garment befitting her position. Several of the servants
who had suspected the matter, poured forth their congratulations.
A marriage, with all the new clothes, and feasting; oh, it would be
delightful! And now the betrothal sugar was to be taken, so the
matter was decided. Might they accompany the lady? Yes, they
were all to come, and one was to go and prepare the lady Sukya;
and so, finally, preceded by a pipe and tabor, the little procession went
forth into the street.</p>

<p>No concealment now. As the neighbours gathered at their doors
they knew why the lady Anunda and Tara went forth. Some wondered,
some sneered; but the majority thought Anunda wise. The
Shastree was to marry again, and there might again be a male child
in the house.</p>

<p>The preparation by Sukya had been made, and the girl Radha,
dressed by her aunt and Gunga, who was there, in a rich saree of
orange and gold, with wreaths of flowers hanging about her, had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
been placed on the dais in the house where they lodged. She wore
heavy ornaments of gold, and Anunda felt proud of her selection for
her lord, as well for Radha's great beauty as for the wealth of which
she had evidence. No, she was no common girl. Here were no
crowds of poor relations; even money was needless; but they would
be too well bred to refuse it.</p>

<p>So they were. The music continued to play a merry measure
suited to the ceremony. The girl's forehead was marked with the
sacred colours; a fragrant paste rubbed upon her hands and arms,
neck and bosom, by Anunda and Tara. Rice and other grain,
emblems of fertility, sprinkled over her head, money poured into her
lap, and sugar put into her mouth; while the sacred hymn and
incantation from the Véda was chanted by Tara and her mother,
and joined in by those who had collected around.</p>

<p>Then all went into the household temple of the dwelling and paid
their adoration to Bhowani and Lakshmee, and the rite was finished.
Radha was the betrothed wife of Vyas Shastree.</p>

<p>"Mayst thou be happy, O my sister!" said Moro Trimmul, who,
though present, had not interfered further than to direct the ceremonies.
"Surely this is a fortunate day for us all. Now I go to
the temple to lay my offerings before the Mother, and, with your
permission, lady, I will visit the Shastree to-morrow. Long have I
desired to know him, for the fame of his learning has gone far and
wide; but who would make a stranger known to him? and surely it
is providential that our houses have thus been united."</p>

<p>"You will be welcome, sir," said Anunda, as she rose to take her
departure.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</a></h2>


<p>Anunda was not a person to allow useless time to elapse between the
ascertained necessity of any act and its completion, and the preparation
for the marriage went on merrily. What stores of flour, and
rice and ghee, and condiments were laid in! What gorgeous dresses
selected! Ah, young English ladies, and indeed I may include
mothers also, who may read these pages, you are not to believe that
wedding trousseaux are confined to your own country and society!
Very far from it. A young Hindu lady, or Mahomedan either&mdash;there
is not much to choose between them in this respect&mdash;is as full
of hope of a liberal, a handsome, outfit on her marriage, as any
fashionable young lady of Belgravia or Mayfair; and believe me, is
as proportionably delighted if it be so.</p>

<p>There was much to spend, and no grudging. So one old cloth-seller<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
had been dispatched to Sholapoor, and another to Wyr&#257;g; one
to Nuldroog also, then a large camp and emporium: and the result was,
as we may say, an overplus of riches. It was hard to select from
the bales on bales which were sent up from the shops; still, piece by
piece, the dresses accumulated, and were indeed lovely. Silk and
gold sarees; silk and cotton mixed; plain cotton with silk borders;
bodice pieces, stiff with gold and brocade&mdash;all betokening wealth
and comfort. No milliner required here. The garments of one
piece, only remarkable for their richness and diversity of colour and
pattern, were such as were, and are still, worn by the better classes
of society. Anunda was determined that no fault could be found
with her own and Tara's selection, and certainly it was better to be
on the liberal side.</p>

<p>Then how busy the goldsmiths were! In the Shastree's school court,
half-a-dozen men, sometimes more, were to be seen sitting over pans
of charcoal, blowpipe in hand, beating silver or gold on small anvils,
and fashioning them into massive and quaintly beautiful ornaments.
Anunda had given some of her old things to be broken up and
re-made. We will not say how many ounces of virgin gold were
added, but here too the good lady was liberal&mdash;very liberal; and
Tara, of her own accord, had added from her own store some
valuable jewels. Yes, the arrangements for the marriage were to
be pushed on; it must be completed within a month, for after that,
there was a "gutt" or planetary conjunction averse to marriage,
which was to last long. As yet the day had not been fixed, but it
must soon be; and the Shastree was passive when it was mentioned.
Not so those with whom he had now irrevocably connected himself.</p>

<p>On the other side, preparations had been as active, though
simpler. Moro Trimmul's object was haste, and he had desired
his aunt and sister to spare nothing within their means. Strangers
as they were in the town, they found the girl Gunga, with whom,
since the ceremony at the temple, Sukya Bye had become intimate,
a very useful ally. She knew what Anunda was preparing. Her
gossips&mdash;the flower-sellers, the cloth-merchants, and the goldsmiths&mdash;detailed
all that was being done, and to aunt and niece they were
amply satisfactory. They knew the Shastree was wealthy, but the
profusion they heard of surprised them.</p>

<p>"The Shastree loves thee, girl," the lady Sukya would say. "He
will spend his wealth on thee. What lucky chance brought us here,
who can tell? else who would have cared for thee? To whom
could we have given thee? Be content; he is not old; he will
love thee, for thou art beautiful. Wait and see."</p>

<p>Truly she was so! Not Tara's tranquil, pensive beauty; not
Anunda's even in her prime. This girl was very different from both.
She was darker than either&mdash;a warm, richly-tinted, clear, golden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
brown, with a skin like velvet; a small head, oval face&mdash;perhaps
more round than oval&mdash;and a mass of thick wavy hair, which, if
loosened, fell far below her waist, curling at the ends; a low broad
forehead, strongly marked arched eyebrows, and a nose straight
and delicate in outline, were perhaps the ordinary possessions of
a good-looking, well-bred Mahratta girl; but the eyes and mouth
were more remarkable, because they gave an index to her character.</p>

<p>"We will not tell what she is like," Anunda said, as her husband
frequently asked her of Radha, for as yet he had not seen her.
Perhaps he was indifferent on the subject, yet hardly so; it would
have been unnatural not to care at all. Certainly, as the days
passed, the Shastree grew somewhat curious, and he had to wait
many more ere he should see her.</p>

<p>"Content thyself, husband," Anunda would say, as he questioned
her; "I have told thee she is beautiful, else I had not noticed
her: she hath a shape like a nymph, eyes like a deer, and a mouth
like that of K&#257;mdeo. What need to say more? Wait and see."
So the Shastree waited patiently. Another would have followed
the girl&mdash;contrived to see her by some means not perhaps over
scrupulously; but the Shastree was very honourable, and such an
alternative did not even suggest itself to him.</p>

<p>But they were right. What Anunda had noticed, and Tara too,
were only the eyes and mouth and the figure. Who could pass
them by unheeded? Such eyes&mdash;so large, so soft in their velvet
blackness when at rest, yet if excited, how different! The long, thick
lashes, which were positively heavy in character, shaded them ordinarily,
and produced a soft, dreamy effect; but if the girl looked
up, or was interested, or suddenly roused, these eyes seemed to glow
internally, and to assume a character almost oppressively fascinating.</p>

<p>Radha well knew their power: since she was a child she had been
told of the beauty of her eyes, and she believed it&mdash;nay, added to
their expression by slightly staining the inner portion of her eyelids,
which gave to the already heavy lashes a softer character if the eyes
were at rest, or increased their effect if they were excited. Lately a
habit had grown upon her of contracting her brows, and dilating her
eyes till their effect was almost fierce, which both her brother and
aunt had tried to check, but it did not leave her easily. Sometimes
it gave place to a look of dreamy languor inexpressibly touching, and
so sorrowful in character that, had the girl been older, it might have
been attributed to some great grief lying at her heart, or some painful
recollection. As it was, it was unsuspected, except by those who
knew the cause.</p>

<p>The mouth followed the eyes. When they were excited by any
emotion, the lips at once closed and were firmly compressed; but
ordinarily they remained a little open in the centre, showing teeth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
white, pure, and glistening with a pearly lustre. The lips were full,
red, and moist&mdash;the upper deeply arched and curved, with the
corners falling back into deep dimples; yet the mouth was small and
delicate, pouting, and decidedly voluptuous when at rest or smiling,
yet capable of being hardened into an expression of self-will and
obstinacy, which indicated an inflexible determination should there
be occasion to exercise it. No wonder that, seeing her in her most
placable moods&mdash;for the girl from the first had appeared charmed by
the prospect of her marriage&mdash;Anunda and Tara had been captivated
by beauty so remarkable. It would have been well, perhaps, could
they have seen the face under other expressions, and so been saved
from what, under different circumstances, had an irresistible fascination.</p>

<p>Need her figure be described? Being younger than Tara, there
was not the same development of form. The arms and throat were
less rounded, yet the lines were as graceful and full of promise of
perfection as hers. Eventually they would be about the same height&mdash;Radha,
perhaps, a shade taller, and both slighter than Anunda
ever had been. Her hands and feet were small and beautifully formed,
more so, perhaps, than Tara's; they were indeed, remarkable features
in her figure&mdash;so much so that, as Tara was bathing her one day, and
washing them, she had held them to her lips and kissed them in
succession involuntarily.</p>

<p>It was difficult to tell her age. Her "birth letter" told the Shastree
she was not yet twelve. Had she exceeded much that age, to their
knowledge, Anunda would have objected to the marriage; indeed, she
could not have been married at all. But she was in reality fourteen,
nay more. Sometimes, when her features relaxed, her eyes soft
and dreamy, her mouth smiling, and her whole face assuming a
loving tenderness of expression, she appeared hardly the age she was
said to be; but when there was any change, and the rigid look already
noticed took its place, she appeared considerably older.</p>

<p>Now, Anunda was by no means desirous of a very young girl for
her husband's new wife. Many had been offered of very tender
age indeed, whom she had invariably declined. She could not be
troubled with a child; and if a thought that Radha might be older
than she was represented to be, ever crossed her mind, a bright smile,
a tender caress from the girl at once removed the doubt, and restored
confidence. As to her figure, it did but furnish earnest of mature
development. And were not many girls precocious? She had been
so herself. Yes, Radha was very beautiful; and, as day after day
passed, Anunda longed the more for the time when she should be
able to clothe her in one of those gorgeous dresses, to deck her with
flowers and jewels, and to present her to her husband a bride worthy
of him&mdash;worthy of her own affection&mdash;the most precious gift she
could make to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>We have said that Radha was older than she was represented&mdash;and
perhaps a brief sketch of her previous history is needful. She
had been an indulged and precocious child, of a vain, weak, but
beautiful mother. Her father, one of the hereditary Josees, or
astrologers, of Wye, had died some years before, and her mother
shortly after him. Moro Trimmul, on succeeding to the care of the
house, had given charge of his sister to his aunt, and betaken himself
to the company of certain wild associates, with whom, from his
powers of learning, he had become an especial favourite. The head
of these was the Rajah Sivaji, whose rapid career to independence
was one of the remarkable events of the times; and the wild exploits
of the young prince, his raids against the Moghuls and Mahomedans
in general, had long since enlisted the sympathies of the Mahratta
people.</p>

<p>Sivaji's early career had been dissolute, but that was a venial fault
among the people. His companions were the young Mahratta gentry,&mdash;yeomen,
and farmers, whom he best loved to draw about him;
above all, young Brahmuns who would join him, whether as priests
or soldiers, or both, in his wild enterprises. Moro Trimmul was one
of these&mdash;one who had grown into his deepest confidence. So long
as Moro's father lived, he had in some degree restrained his son;
but his private meetings with his prince were still frequent; and in
the plays and recitations, of which Sivaji was passionately fond,
Moro was generally an actor and reciter. Thus it was that Sivaji
frequently came to Wye, and put up at the Josee's house; and so he
came to know Radha&mdash;a beautiful child then, whom he could caress
without hindrance. He a Mahratta, she a Brahmun&mdash;any union was
impossible; and yet she grew to be more than interesting to him as
she advanced in age.</p>

<p>Eventually Radha's betrothed husband died. Other offers were
made for her, but were always refused, so peremptorily, that people
believed the report designedly set afoot by her brother and Sukya
Bye, that she was to be married to a distant relative who, now absent
on pilgrimages, would return and claim her, or she would have to
be taken to him. And so the girl grew, the time for marriage
passed, and the Rajah's visits, often clandestine, were encouraged by
aunt and nephew, with what ultimate hope of result might be imagined.
Yet both were careful there should be no scandal.</p>

<p>Perhaps their scheme might have succeeded had not Sivaji himself,
now feeling his way to power, seen the peril of the connection. Was
she wife or widow, there might have been fewer scruples, but, an unmarried
Brahmun girl would be a burden, a disgrace, which he dared
not encounter&mdash;one that would not fail to be resented by the priests,
whom it was his aim to gain. He could not spare one so devoted, so
able, and so unscrupulous as Moro Trimmul, nor could he replace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
him; he needed many such, and he loved him too much to break
with him on this point.</p>

<p>It was a hard struggle. But the young prince, whose firm will and
self-control finally won him a kingdom, successfully resisted the opportunities
deliberately offered. As the girl grew, as his intercourse
with the house became more and more unreserved, it was clear to
him that her love for him was growing as part of her existence. The
girl, for whom he had always a kind word and free greeting, who
claimed the privilege of serving "her Rajah," when he put up at their
house, became by degrees shy and reserved; cried if he spoke kindly
to her, and trembled if he approached her. He could not be mistaken
in those eyes: they told their own story&mdash;love.</p>

<p>Under such circumstances, among such people, love is passion.
It has no medium except in maturer age and constant association.
The girl&mdash;still a child in years&mdash;loved deeply, passionately; and as
she grew older, month by month, day by day, the news of her prince's
exploits, now beginning to be sung in ballads through the country,
excited her fearfully. Her aunt and brother had detected her in more
than one attempt to escape to him, and, fearful of the result, had prevented
it. Had he taken her away, would they have pursued?
Surely not; but he was careful&mdash;he admitted his own danger to himself&mdash;and
he gradually avoided the house, though he clung the more
closely to Moro Trimmul. Radha found means to send occasional
messages to him&mdash;a child's love, a child's yearning for him were told
to him; and we know that, in some instances, a child's love&mdash;there
and here the same&mdash;is more passionate, because more pure and more
absorbing, than a woman's. What was marriage to her? If she
could only be with her Rajah&mdash;to serve him, to live with him, to
ride, nay, to fight with him&mdash;she would go, or die.</p>

<p>The last time Sivaji had seen her she had grown desperate. She
had never spoken so to him before; but she had told him she must
die if he did not take her away. "Nay, but I will come with thee,"
she cried, "even if thou cast me out among thy servants." And he
confided this to her brother. "For my sake," he said, impressively,
"if not for thine and hers, keep her safe; take her away and have
her married; the farther away from hence the better. It is no use
speaking to her. Moro Trimmul! save me from the temptation, thyself
from the contumely this would bring upon us. I know what is in
thy heart; but, beautiful as she is, it cannot be."</p>

<p>So a plan was quickly arranged between them. Moro had an
intimate acquaintance with the Mahratta gentry of the Dekhan, and
he was despatched to canvass them. This necessitated journeys
from place to place. He was well provided with money, and he
travelled, as one under vows of pilgrimage, to different shrines. Thus
opportunity might occur for marrying Radha; and, leaving all servants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
behind him but a few men in whom he had perfect confidence,
he took his aunt Sukya Bye with him as protection to his sister. No
one cared to inquire who the young prince's envoy and counsellor
was, or what his family affairs were. Enough that he had a sister
and an aunt with him, and was conducting his secret mission with
admirable policy and address.</p>

<p>Thus he at length arrived at Tooljapoor alone. The rainy season
had set in, and travelling was no longer pleasant or easy. The
town was a good position for his purpose, and there were many rich
families and landholders in the "Bâlâ Ghaut" province to be
brought over. For a time he secluded himself, and lived humbly
in a hired lodging or in one of the courts of the temple. Here he
had seen Gunga, and here also he daily watched Tara as she and her
mother performed their worship. Even thus early the advantage of
marrying his sister to the Shastree, of whose household circumstances
Gunga had told him, had appeared most desirable; but as his
passion for Tara grew, it was a thing to be accomplished at all
hazards. Gunga did not appear able to help him, for it was clear
that neither the Shastree nor his wife noticed the inferior priestesses
of her class, and Tara never spoke to them. He therefore secured
a good house for some months, and sent for his aunt and Radha
from Punderpoor, where he had left them: and, till their arrival,
had busied himself in obtaining local information for the furtherance
of his future designs.</p>

<p>On leaving their home at Wye, and after Radha's first paroxysms
of disappointment were past, Sukya Bye and Moro Trimmul had instructed
the girl what to do. Perhaps, in despair of accomplishing
her ends, or with the desire of all Hindu girls for an early settlement,
she was an apt scholar. Radha was to deny all knowledge of
her age, to assume a childish demeanour, to acquiesce modestly, and
as she saw other girls do, if she were proposed for. She was
assured she would be given to none but a man of wealth&mdash;her beauty
would secure her this. If possible he should be young; but this was
a difficult point, and what matter if he were old? She could have
jewels, rich clothes, an establishment of her own&mdash;she would have
all these secured to her, and afterwards would be her own mistress.</p>

<p>But if she refused, or opposed these efforts in her behalf, she
would soon be too old to be assisted at all. As it was, few would
believe her to be within the marriageable period for Brahmun girls.
In a year, nay less, her marriage would be impossible, and she must
be treated like a widow, shaven and degraded, or married to a
dagger,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and turned into a temple to shift for herself.</p>
<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>
<p>Was it wonderful that the girl submitted to, nay, even assisted in,
their deceptions, or that those eyes looked dreamily after her own
prince, while her spirit, chafing within, carried her, in those moments
of abstraction, away into his glorious mountains, to be loved and
caressed as she felt he, and, he only, could love and caress her if
she were with him?</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</a></h2>


<p>After preparations for the Shastree's marriage had been actively
commenced on both sides, there was no further hindrance. Moro
Trimmul having been made known to the Shastree by Anunda, as
she had promised, the two men soon found a day in the calendar, so
far unexceptionable as regarded planetary influences, that they at
once fixed upon it; and the ladies, having been consulted, declared
there were no objections or hindrances now, for on both sides of
the houses everything was prepared.</p>

<p>Meanwhile his new acquaintance was a delightful addition to
Vyas Shastree's circle of friends. Who more accomplished for his
age than Moro Trimmul, more fascinating in manner, or astute in
argument and judgment? He had not the refined beauty of his
sister, except that his eyes were, like hers, large, soft, and very black,
with the same habit of dilation, relaxing into an almost womanish
tenderness: but when aroused, their excited expression was infinitely
more fierce than Radha's, even to savage cruelty. The mouth was
always coarse and sensual, but there was at least good-humour about
it if he were not angered, and a strength of character in the
countenance which could not be mistaken. Now, nothing occurred
to cause even a passing cloud, and the days which intervened
between the betrothal and the marriage were pleasantly spent by
all. Even Radha was interested, and clung more closely to Tara
than ever; for with Anunda, as with her aunt, she preserved the
habitual reserve and respect required by their positions.</p>

<p>"I will go to the temple, daughter," said Anunda one evening,
"and keep thy father there. Do thou bring Radha here, and let
her look at the dresses and jewels: if there is anything she wants
in addition, tell me, and we will get it." The good lady could not
do too much.</p>

<p>Kind Anunda! it was so considerate. Could any doubt of her
ultimate happiness remain in the girl's heart? What other "sister
wife" would have cared so for her?</p>

<p>Oh, the girl's delight at those gorgeous clothes and jewels! She
had heard of splendid gifts at marriages, and there was one at Wye<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
in which she had helped to deck the bride; and when she had seen
her&mdash;she was but a mere child&mdash;dressed in a brocade garment stiff
with gold, she had wondered whether it would ever be possible to
possess one like it. There were several&mdash;green and gold, crimson
and gold, purple and gold. The most glossy of Pyetun silks, soft
muslin sarees from Narrainpett and Dhunwar, of which she had
heard, but had never seen; they did not come to her country: all
were beautiful.</p>

<p>Then the ornaments. There were massive gold chain anklets,
with small bells to them, armlets, bracelets, ear-rings, necklaces.
There was the sacred "talee," which would be tied round her
neck. Tara showed them all as they were laid out in cotton upon a
tray covered with red muslin. How beautiful they were! and all
would belong to her; they would be put on her the day of the ceremony,
and her own taken off as she entered the house. Then
the place where she was to be bathed and dressed was newly
coloured and plastered, and the comfort of the house and its pretty
decorations&mdash;all satisfied the girl's longing. It was what she had
pictured to herself; and Tara said her father was kind, so kind&mdash;he
would love his little wife after his quiet fashion, and deny her
nothing.</p>

<p>So it was not to be wondered at if any repugnance which she
had felt was fast passing away, and if, when her brother asked her
whether she would be content, she told him she was grateful for what
he had done; and for the time perhaps she was so.</p>

<p>Sukya Bye had told her nephew of Radha's visit to the Shastree's
house by stealth with Tara: she was afraid he might hear of it
otherwise, perhaps through the servants or Gunga, and was rejoiced
that he considered it a happy circumstance. "She will be satisfied
with the wealth," he said, "and all that she sees will excite the desire
for more, and so, aunt, we shall best hold her to our purposes. She
cannot recede now; and, while moulding the Shastree to her will, by-and-by
she need not forget Sivaji Rajah." But he did not tell this
to Radha; and neither by her brother, nor Sukya Bye, was any
reference made to the past. When all was beyond chance of disturbance,
he would set her to work to compass his own ends.</p>

<p>The Shastree and Pundit were of different schools of philosophy;
the former, as we know, belonged to the ancient, and, as he considered,
orthodox, Vedantic school of Véda Vasa; the Pundit to the
more modern Mimansa school of Jomiai, and to the doctrines and
mythological histories of the Poorans. So they had discussions, in
which other Brahmuns of the town joined, while the ladies sat
behind a screen and heard their disputations, and Tara explained
to them what she could follow. Or the friends played at chess, both
having excellent skill;&mdash;the Shastree calm and steady, the Pundit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
fiery and impetuous, as were their natures; and so they had many an
earnest battle.</p>

<p>It was not long before the politics which then agitated the country
began to be discussed between them. They lived under the same
Mahomedan government, that of Beejapoor: but while Tooljapoor
and the districts around it were as yet in entire subjection, those
to the west&mdash;particularly the wild rugged country beyond Wye, the
Mawuls or mountain-valleys of the Ghauts, stretching into the
Dekhan&mdash;owed but a slight allegiance to the Mahomedan dynasty,
and perhaps had never been completely subdued. Here it was that
many of the oldest Mahratta families had taken refuge after the
overthrow of the Hindu dynasty of Deogurh, the modern Dowlutabad,
and the subsequent subjection of the country by the Mahomedan
Emperors of Delhi; and it was among these families, the Bhóslays,
Nimbalkurs, Morays, Ghoreparays, and others, that the germs of that
combination to resist&mdash;to them an oppressive and corrupt government&mdash;existed,
which was presently to be ripened into a successful
revolution.</p>

<p>On the other hand, this dynasty of Beejapoor had already been
attacked by the immense power of the Emperors of Delhi; and
while the independent kingdom of Ahmednugger&mdash;itself at one
period little inferior in splendour to that of Beejapoor&mdash;had been
entirely subdued, and the princes of its house annihilated by the
Moghuls, any combination to resist them by the two states had
not only been rendered impossible, but it was clear that Beejapoor
would follow its example: and those were not wanting who hoped,
under a new power, to regain many privileges which hitherto had
been withheld from them.</p>

<p>But it was in the antagonism of the two contending Mahomedan
powers that the Hindu families of the Dekhan saw the means of
emancipation from both. It might be a work of time, and of immense
labour and skill: but the opportunity seemed to present itself;
and while feigning submission alike to the Moghuls, as after the conquest
of Ahmednugger their forces were poured into the provinces
which had formed that kingdom, and, on the other hand, to the older-established
dynasty of Beejapoor, a stirring spirit began to be aroused
among the Mahrattas; and that secret combination silently progressed,
of which Moro Pundit was one among many other agents
employed by Sivaji, the prince to whom all now looked as the present
head, if not the instigator, of the movement.</p>

<p>It had, in fact, already been some time covertly in progress. Shahji
Bhóslay, the father, of Sivaji, had commenced it in a series of wild
irregular forays and raids from his patrimonial estate, which was
situated among the Mawuls west of Poona, against the Mahomedan
posts and garrisons of the western provinces of Beejapoor. For a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
time he was successful, but only as a mere freebooter; and in the
end he was defeated, taken prisoner, and confined in a dungeon in
Beejapoor for several years by the monarch Mahmood Adil Shah,
the father of the king reigning at Beejapoor at the period of our
tale. But Mahmood was not implacable. On the intercession of
his mother, by whose wise counsels he had often been guided, Shahji
was not only released but raised to a high command, and during the
subsequent invasion of Beejapoor by the Moghuls did good service,
and so the progress of the Mahratta power was stayed.</p>

<p>Of his two sons, Sivaji early took the lead, and, encouraged by
his mother, a lady of high family and ambition, and admirable
judgment, he aspired to be the head of a Mahratta confederacy.
What progress he eventually made is already matter of history,
which will have no record in these pages; but at the time of which
we write, he was strengthening himself in his own wild country,
collecting adherents, canvassing those who still held aloof, fortifying
rugged and inaccessible strongholds, and, by the suddenness
and successful issue of his continuous forays, was rendering himself
famous in the eyes of the people. While he treated with both
of the rival Mahomedan powers by turns, he took his own course;
and yielding alternately to each whenever their force was locally
in excess of his own, was in reality faithful to neither.</p>

<p>To Sivaji, also, belonged the prestige which none else had dared
to assume&mdash;that of receiving aid from heavenly powers. The goddess
Bhowani was the tutelar deity of his family; and it was the
popular belief that she had chosen his father as the champion of
her faith, but that he had transgressed warnings and visions, and,
implacable as she was believed to be, she had cast him off. It was
otherwise, however, with his second son Sivaji. She had chosen
him to be the scourge of the cow-slaying, impure, and licentious
Mahomedans. The cries of her votaries had arisen to her, and the
land was to be purged of uncleanness. Temples would be again
filled with Brahmuns, and the sweet incense of pure sacrifice would
ascend to her. The mother of Sivaji, it was reported, saw and
recorded visions, too glorious to relate, in which her son was a victorious
conqueror, and the infidel Mahomedans were slain in tens of
thousands by the Mahratta people in those great battles which were
to ensue. And these visions were believed.</p>

<p>As yet these prophecies were circulated privately among the
people, but there was not a Mahratta, far or near, who did not
know of them. Ballads were written about them, and sung at
fairs and markets. Women composed and chanted extempore
verses as the household mills flew merrily round in the early morning.
Men sang them to their oxen as they ploughed, or drew
water from their wells; and so a spirit spread through the people
which eventually became irresistibly powerful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>In this excitement, too, existed the incentive to the worship of
Bhowani at all her most celebrated shrines; and everywhere&mdash;to
gather her votaries together, to excite them to action, and to warn
them to be ready when the time arrived&mdash;were agents such as Moro
Trimmul, despatched by the young chieftain. Nothing appeared on
the surface. Experience had taught extreme caution. There were
no assemblies of armed men, no displays of force: an occasional successful
raid or resistance by Sivaji kept up what might well be
called the national spirit; but all delayed to strike, till, in the expressive
Mahratta phrase, Dônguras, lavilé Déva, "the fire was on the
hills."</p>

<p>Very dexterously, therefore, and after having prepared him for the
communication, did Moro Trimmul confide to the Shastree some
of the popularly-reported plans of his friend and prince, and sought
his counsel and assistance, and partly also the purport of his own
mission. He asked information as to the families of the Bâlâ
Ghaut, the Nimbalkurs of Wasi, the Kallays of Nelinga, the Bhóslays
and Ghoreparays of Akalkote, all neighbours; and also respecting
the wealthy yeomen and farmers of the country. He did not mention
Pahar Singh, with whom, through the Gosaees of Kullianee,
and their agency at Tooljapoor, he had already opened negotiations,
and found the robber chieftain fickle and undecided, extravagant in
his demands for estates, for high command, and other rewards.</p>

<p>Nor did he disclose that weightier secret, known to his prince and
himself, on which, for the present, the success of their enterprise
rested. Khan Mahomed, the Wuzeer, or Prime Minister, of Beejapoor,
might be detached, it was said, from the royal interest of his house;
and he was then, with a large army, lying at and about Nuldroog,
little more than twenty miles distant from Tooljapoor. To this man,
at his own request, in phrases only to be interpreted by himself, a
letter had been forwarded through the Gosaee banker's agent at
Tooljapoor; but no reply had been received. Nor was Moro
Trimmul sanguine on the subject, for reports of the Wuzeer's
intrigues in other quarters were in men's mouths. No; it was from
the Mahratta families alone that he had expectations; and he knew that
at the ensuing festival, all or most of the province would assemble at
Tooljapoor.</p>

<p>To say that he found a zealous coadjutor, or hoped for one, in the
Shastree, would not be correct. The Shastree was not ambitious.
He enjoyed already, as we know, a very lucrative and prominent
position, in which he was honoured and respected. He avoided all
Mahomedans upon principle; but the governors of the province often
sought his advice and assistance in civil and judicial matters regarding
Hindus, and he was not only never molested, but, on the contrary,
respected and treated with consideration, and had even been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
invited to court. He had, therefore, no quarrel with the Mahomedans,
and he well knew their power. He had watched Shahji's failures,
and he had noted the effect of Sivaji's efforts; still he admitted there
was more chance of success now than before; and he agreed to assist
Moro Trimmul, by bringing him into communication with the gentry
of the province, provided he were not required to take any prominent
part in what should follow. To say that Vyas Shastree was indifferent
in this matter, would be incorrect; but to anticipate enthusiasm
or personal zeal would have been impossible from his character,
and Moro Trimmul did not expect them.</p>

<p>"After the ceremony," he said to the Shastree, "Radha, of course,
will remain with you. Sukya Bye will return to Wye with the
servants. Give me, then, letters to the Nimbalkurs of Wasi, and to
such others as you please, and I will go alone. Introduce me as a
reciter of plays, and I will make my own way unnoticed and unsuspected.
Here I can be of no use, and may even attract suspicion."</p>

<p>To this plan Vyas Shastree gave his cordial consent. Moro Trimmul
would go before the Now Râtree, and return for the festival.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</a></h2>


<p>I am afraid it would take more time than the limits of this history will
afford, were I to describe minutely all the festivities and observances
of Radha's marriage. I assure you, dear readers, that a proper,
orthodox Hindu marriage, is a very tiresome affair; and, like many
other marriages, perhaps, everybody is glad when it is over. Very
noisy, tediously minute in ceremonial, liable to interruption from
disputes&mdash;it is often an arena for rival factions of families to fight
out all the ill feeling, discontent, and jealousy which have accumulated
for years. Sometimes the feasts provided are not eaten, and
have to be thrown away or given to beggars. Musicians won't play,
processions can't be formed, or are interrupted in progress: offence
is taken at trifles, and the whole proceeding rocks to and fro as
though it would tumble to pieces altogether, till it suddenly comes
right, and affairs go on&mdash;to a happy conclusion, or otherwise, as it
may be.</p>

<p>When all prospers, it is a right merry affair; but I am afraid you,
dear young lady, would be very weary if you had to be married as
Radha was. No such thing as going to church comfortably in a
luxurious carriage, to be attended to the altar by six loving and
lovely bridesmaids, to hear there a short, simple, affecting service
and blessing, to sign your maiden name for the last time in the
vestry, and to go home, having dried your eyes on the most delicate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
of lace-bordered cambric pocket-handkerchiefs, to a champagne breakfast,
all the delicacies of the season, a carriage and four, and&mdash;unlimited
bliss in prospect.</p>

<p>Ah, no! with Radha it was very different. Her marriage ceremonies&mdash;will
you believe it?&mdash;occupied ten days of really very hard
work. So many dressings and undressings; so many bathings; so
many anointings; so many changes of ornaments; such smotherings
in flowers, and in large sheets, lest her husband should see her;
such being carried from place to place by the servants, lest her feet
might touch the ground&mdash;once too by her husband, whom she could
feel, but not see; and a rare strong arm and hand his was, taking
her up, she felt, as if she were a child, and gently and respectfully
too. Then worshippings at the great temple, where she had never
been before, and where the priests put flowers on her and led her
into the shrine where "the little Mother" sat, with her weird red eyes
blinking through the smoke, and Radha was half frightened by
them; greetings, too, from the people with whom the marriage was
popular; and the flower-sellers and comfit-makers poured baskets of
their stocks over her and her decorated litter, while she looked
curiously about her from under the veil of jessamine flowers which
covered her face, and acknowledged with shy timid gestures their
hearty salutations. No doubt a great deal of this was excellent fun,
and the girl's spirits rose with the genial joyousness; but at times
she was very weary.</p>

<p>Seldom had there been a merrier wedding. What jokes were
played off by her brother, who was a capital hand, as we know, at
acting plays, disguising himself, and personating characters, with
which he mercilessly interrupted the orthodox ceremonies. Now
a Mahomedan mendicant, whose intrusion was resisted by the
servants, and whose presence had polluted the food, proved to be
he; or the pipers' instruments were filled with wax, and they blew
discordant screeches, or could not blow at all; or a pertinacious
begging Brahmun or Byragee pestered them when most engaged,
insisted on seeing the bride, or threatened, otherwise, to cut himself
and bring trouble on her. Now one thing, now another; teasing
his sister, playing a sly joke with Anunda, tormenting the Shastree
in all manner of ways, he was the life of the meeting, and always
so disguised as to dress, figure, and even voice, that no one
recognized him.</p>

<p>Then were there not all the pipers of the country? the temple
musicians, and drums of all kinds, tenor and bass? Such crashes
of noise! Village bands, the temple musicians, and the hired performers,
and dancing women, all playing different tunes at the same
moment. The horn-players and drums of half the country came
in hopes of largess; and there was one burly fellow from Andoora,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
near Nuldroog, whose horn had wreaths of flowers tied to it, with
gold and silver tinsel ribbon, the wild screams of whose instrument,
and sometimes its mellow quivering notes, could be heard high
above all the others.</p>

<p>And, to be sure, what feasting! The household cooking-pans
were not half big enough, and those from the temple had to be
borrowed: and the neighbours' kitchens, on both sides, were filled
with cooks. Pecks and bushels of rice, butter, vegetable stews, and
curries; sweet things, hot things, savoury things; and Anunda's
famous "poorees," reserved for the choicest guests&mdash;some even
made by herself and Tara.</p>

<p>There was no room in the house or in the courts for eating, so
the street outside was swept and watered; and every day, early
in the afternoon, you might see a posse of stout young Brahmuns
laying down fresh green plantain-leaves in double rows on the
ground, with broad alleys between them, and then long files of
clean-shaven Brahmuns sit down behind them; and after them a
procession of men bearing on their shoulders huge pans full of rice,
hot from the kitchen, and slung on poles&mdash;baskets of hot bread,
poorees, curries, stews, and the like, would march down the middle,
ladling out portions of all to each, and helping liberally to melted
butter, hot "chutnees," and other toothsome condiments.</p>

<p>And the men ate and ate till they could eat no more, and the
crowds on the house-terraces above them watched the eating, cheered
the eaters, and bandied free jokes from side to side of the street at
themselves, the eaters, the carriers of the viands, or the passengers.
So they ate and ate by hundreds and hundreds at a time; and many
a hungry Brahmun, hardly knowing how to get a meal of coarse
jowaree cakes in his own home, took his water-vessel and blanket,
travelled from twenty to thirty miles round to the wedding, received
a hearty welcome, and ate as he had perhaps never eaten before, and
remembered it all his life afterwards.</p>

<p>Yes, it was a capital wedding; and the village and town gossips
who criticised it at the time, and spoke of it afterwards, could actually
find no fault. There was not a poor old hag in Tooljapoor or
Sindphul, ay, and for the matter of that, in other villages further
distant, who did not get a hearty meal; or if she were too infirm to
stay and eat, a liberal dole of flour, or rice and butter, with salt and
pepper. Not a family of Mahrattas in the town, nor, indeed, respectable
Mahomedans either, who had not materials for a meal sent
to them, accompanied by pipe and tabor, horn and drum, or band and
trumpets, according to the scale of their rank. And from all friends,
presents for the bride, in proportion to their means, from the
richest silken and gold sarees, down to a humble cotton bodice,
added to the stores with which Radha was already provided.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>One by one the ceremonies were finished. The last&mdash;the solemn
rite of actual marriage&mdash;as the bride and bridegroom sat side by
side, when the consecrated thread was wound round them by the
attendant Brahmuns, and the mystic hymns and invocations chanted;
when their garments were tied together in the irrevocable knot,
and they repeated the promises and vows, much like our own, to
love and cherish each other&mdash;then Radha's veil was raised; and
though he had seen her form for many days in succession, Vyas
Shastree now saw his young wife's beautiful face for the first time.</p>

<p>It was a happy look, in one of her happy moods. Those
glorious eyes were not excited, but soft, timid, and shyly raised to
him in trust and confidence. Anunda and Tara had watched for
the effect upon him with beating hearts and clasped hands. There
could be no doubt of the expression of his face&mdash;wonder first, then
gratification, perhaps love. "Thou wast right, wife," he said
afterwards; "she hath a nymph's form, a deer's eyes, and a mouth
like K&#257;mdeo."</p>

<p>So it was all finished at last; the guests departed, the courts were
swept, and the house again cleaned out. The garlands of leaves and
flowers still hung at the gate, and from pillar to pillar of the verandah;
and certain post-nuptial ceremonies performed at the temple was all
that remained of the outer show of the marriage. Within was the
girl-bride, happy in being free from her brother, whom she feared
though she loved him, and from her aunt, whom she disliked as well
as feared; happy in her new sister-wife, to whom she felt like a
daughter; happier in Tara, a sister in truth, and she never had
known one before; content, too, to see the Shastree unreservedly, and
to feel that her beauty grew on him&mdash;for as yet, beyond a few words,
they had not spoken.</p>

<p>As Moro Trimmul had determined, Sukya Bye was despatched to
their home a few days after the ceremony. She had pleaded hard
to be allowed to stay over the Now Râtree, and Anunda had asked
the favour at her instance; but her nephew was distinct in his refusal,
yet not so as to display anger or vexation. It was simply
impossible, he said; she had been too long absent from home, and
he himself must go on his own affairs. So she received parting
gifts of rich silk cloths from Radha, Anunda, and the Shastree, and
departed to Wye.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The last night that Moro Trimmul was to remain at Tooljapoor, he
took an opportunity of telling Radha that he should pretend to go
out, but conceal himself in the school court, which was not lighted,
and that she was to come to him when all were asleep or retired; he
should wait for her there, for he had much to say to her.</p>

<p>So he had. How he had restrained himself hitherto he knew not.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
How, day by day, he had seen Tara, spoken to her, amused her, excited
her, gloated over her beauty, which, if remarkable abroad
where she was guarded, was in a thousand degrees more captivating
and enthralling in the free household intercourse&mdash;and yet had done
nothing towards possessing himself of her&mdash;was what he could
neither understand nor endure any longer. Gunga could not help
him; he saw clearly that Tara utterly refused communication
with her: utterly refused to participate in the lower degrees of
ceremonies and orgies at which Gunga assisted with a lower order
of priests who officiated for the inferior castes of the people; and she
refused the mystic marriage to the sword of the goddess, which
the "Moorlees" performed in order to cloak their profligacy.</p>

<p>Gunga, therefore, baffled for a while, bided her time; but she
and her sister priestesses had vowed revenge, and were all in Moro
Trimmul's interest. Meanwhile his sister must help him; and this,
with cruel perseverance, it was his object to effect through her at
any risk.</p>

<p>He waited long, for the girl could not get away unobserved.
At last she came, scared and terrified lest her absence should be
detected; but all were asleep&mdash;Tara beside her in the verandah,
the Shastree among his books in the book-room, Anunda in her
own sleeping-room within. She did not find her brother in better
temper for his detention.</p>

<p>"Take this," he said to her, returning a gold anklet of Tara's,
which Radha had borrowed from her to be copied; "for I go to-morrow
early, and shall not see thee again till the Now Râtree;
but thou hast kept me long, girl, and I had much to say to thee."</p>

<p>"The Shastree was awake reading: even till now I could not pass
his door," she said; "be quick, brother."</p>

<p>"Ah, thou art trembling. Is this the girl who would have fled to
Sivaji Rajah; and art thou changed already into a Shastree's
wife?" he said, with a sneer.</p>

<p>The girl shivered. "Do not say such things, brother. I strive
to put them away, and they will go, perhaps; yes, they will go, when
no one tells me of him."</p>

<p>Her brother laughed. "No, they shall not go, Radha, if I can
prevent it; but thou must be patient, girl. So much for thyself;
now for me."</p>

<p>"What can I do, brother?"</p>

<p>"Thou canst gain Tara for me. Nay, Radha," he continued, as
she trembled still more, and hung to the court door in terror,
"none of this cowardice! I tell thee it must be, and thou must do it."</p>

<p>"Brother! brother!" gasped the girl, piteously. "Not I&mdash;not
I! What can I do? O, not I! O, not I!"</p>

<p>"What canst thou do? Much," he returned, sharply; "listen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
Radha. Such things are no sin. She is a Brahmun, as I am; she
is a widow. She is a Moorlee, as free as Gunga, or any of them,
and she can please herself. I know she is not indifferent to me:
it is for thee to improve this. Speak to her of me, lead her to
think of me, tell her what deeds I have done with thy Rajah&mdash;I
am with him in them&mdash;and sing her our country ballads. I tell
thee, girl, if thou doest all this, it will gain her."</p>

<p>"Never, brother, never; she has no heart for thee. She shuddered
yesterday when I spoke of thee. I saw her&mdash;I could not be
mistaken. Her heart is with the gods, in her books, cold and dead.
O brother, think not of her! What can I do?"</p>

<p>"Is it so, sister?" he said sneeringly. "Then she must be
awakened, and that dead heart gain new life; Radha, thou must do
it, thou!&mdash;else"&mdash;he felt the girl shivering as he grasped her arm,
and shook her savagely&mdash;"else, wilt thou be long here? Would
this Shastree keep thee one hour in his house if he thought, much less
if he knew, thou hadst been married before, girl? Yes, married
before! Ah, that touches thee! And listen more, if my affair is not
furthered he shall know it. What if he cast thee out? Thou canst
go to the temple like Tara; thou canst go to him&mdash;to Sivaji&mdash;but
thou wilt be a reproach and an outcast. Choose!&mdash;to be happy as
I have placed thee, or as I have said. One or other, girl! the last,
and what I have risked for thee&mdash;what I have done for thee&mdash;will
be repaid. O sister! what Sivaji Rajah is to thee, a burning thought
day and night, so Tara is to me, and more. Dost thou hear?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I," gasped the terrified girl, "I hear&mdash;I hear. O brother, be
not cruel, do not destroy me; or, if thou wilt, one blow of thy knife&mdash;now&mdash;now&mdash;here,"
and she bared her breast. "It will be mercy&mdash;strike!"</p>

<p>"Poor fool," said Moro Trimmul, "I would not harm thee. Go, remember
what I have said, and do as I tell thee. If she be in the same
mood when I return, why then&mdash;&mdash;Go," he continued, interrupting
himself, "I can wait no longer. Fear not, my blessing is on thee," and
he put his hands on her head. "For his sake, my lord, my prince and
thine, thou shalt come to no harm. Go!" And saying this he put
her gently away from him into the court, closed the door, and easily
climbing the low wall, dropped into the street beyond.</p>

<p>"One thing more ere the night passes," he said, as he walked
rapidly through the deserted streets to the house they had lived in, near
the Shastree's: "if she is there, well; if not, I must seek her. What
she wanted must have been brought ere this."</p>

<p>"She is within, master," said a man sitting at the gate, with a
black blanket round him, who spoke ere Moro Trimmul could ask;
"she has been here an hour or more; and here are some things the
sonar brought this evening when you were absent."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>"Good," said the Pundit, passing in; "see that no one enters."</p>

<p>The man laughed. "It is too late, master, now. No one will come.
Are we to leave early?"</p>

<p>"Tell them to bring the horses at daylight," he replied; "we will
get on to Darasew before noon. We must be at Thair before night.
Is all prepared?"</p>

<p>"Yes, the saddle-bags are packed, and Bheema and myself remain;
all the rest went with the lady Sukya."</p>

<p>"Then go and sleep, for we have a long journey to-morrow. I do
not need thee. Give me the key of the court door. I can lock myself
in, and I shall be awake long before you in the morning."</p>

<p>He entered the court and locked the gate behind him. A lamp was
burning in a recess of the verandah, and its light fell upon the
figure of the girl Gunga, who had covered herself with a sheet, and,
most likely weary with waiting for him, had fallen asleep. She
did not hear him; and as he had left his shoes by the side of the
outer door, there was no noise whatever from his bare feet.</p>

<p>Moro Trimmul stood over her, and, as he did so, she moved uneasily
in her sleep, turned and said something; he could not catch the
words. Then some cruel thoughts passed suddenly through his
mind. Gunga knew too much; a blow of his knife would silence
for ever all chance of disclosure of what had been done for Radha;
the gold he had to give her would be saved. There was a large well
or cistern behind the house; the wall of the back-yard hung over it;
it was a place where the women of the town washed their clothes,
and was so held to be unclean. That would hide her. A Moorlee?
What Moorlee had not jealousies and strifes? Who would care for
her? And he drew the dagger and stood over her in an attitude
to strike.</p>

<p>Why he hesitated he could never tell; certainly it was not from
fear. Perhaps some lingering feeling of compassion for one so young&mdash;perhaps
the memory of some caress&mdash;stayed the blow for an instant,
for he did not strike. The light fell full on her eyes and face
as she turned, and she smiled and awoke suddenly.</p>

<p>"I dreamed of thee, beloved," she said, stretching out her arms to
him, "and thou art here&mdash;&mdash;But why the knife?" she continued,
quickly sitting up, as the light gleamed on the blade. "Moro!&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;fear
thee; why dost thou look at me so? Ah!" and she covered
her eyes with her hand, expecting death.</p>

<p>"Only to cut these strings," he said, with a hard laugh, recovering
himself and dividing the cord which was tied round the paper containing
the gold anklets. "Look, Gunga!" and he held them up to
the light, and shook them till the little bells on them clashed gently.</p>

<p>"Thou art good," she said, looking up as he held them above her,
still shaking them; "they are very, very beautiful, but thou wilt not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
give them to me, for thou hast not got Tara. Ah! thou hast just
come from her, and wilt not give them. Go! go back to her."</p>

<p>"But my sister is her father's wife, and these are heavier than
Tara's. I have not broken faith with thee, Gunga," he replied, "nor
my oath at the Pâp-nâs temple. Take them&mdash;they are thine henceforth.
And now wilt thou go with me, Gunga? I have prepared
a horse for thee, and Bheema can walk."</p>

<p>"To the end of life," cried the girl, who had risen to her knees to
put on the anklets, and who now clasped his feet,&mdash;"to the end of
life! Kill me if thou wilt, Moro Trimmul, who would care? It
would be no pain to Gunga."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.</a></h2>


<p>A thick heavy rain was falling, which had lasted nearly all day without
intermission, and the afternoon was now advanced. The sky was
one uniform tint of dark grey, in which, near the horizon, some yellowish,
lurid colour occasionally appeared. Dark masses of cloud came
up slowly from the south-west at times, causing a deeper gloom as
they passed overhead, accompanied by bursts of rain, which sometimes
fell in sheets, deluging the ground, and dashing up muddy
spray from the soft earth. The air was stifling; and there was a
strong sulphurous smell with the rain, which increased the disagreeable
effect of the close, hot atmosphere. Sometimes a gentle breeze,
hardly sufficient to give the rain a slanting direction, arose, and felt refreshing;
but as the heavy clouds passed, it died away, and the rain
fell perpendicularly again, with a constant monotonous plash, which,
coming from a wide plain, sounded like a dull roar.</p>

<p>Little could be seen of the plain itself; for not only was the
rain too thick to allow of any distance to appear definitely, but
there was a steamy mist rising from the previously heated earth,
which increased the already existing dimness and gloom. Sometimes
a few trees in the vicinity, which appeared tall and ghostly
in the grey light and thick air, stood out more in detail as the rain
slackened for a while, and seemed to give promise of breaking; and
on these occasions two villages became dimly visible; one of them
nearly a mile distant, the other perhaps half a mile farther, situated
to the right and left of what, in dry weather, was a well-beaten
road-track, but which could only now be known as such, by being
bare of grass, and by the slightly raised banks, covered here and
there by low bushes, which bounded it.</p>

<p>The place we are about to describe occupied the summit of a
small eminence, below which, in a valley watered by a rivulet, was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
village surrounded by tall crops of grain, now coming into ear,
mingled with fields of cotton, as yet very low, and pulse, and other
cereals, generally about waist-high. This difference in the height of
the crops left the valley comparatively open; and the road-track
could be followed by the eye, whenever the mist and rain cleared
a little&mdash;through the fields to the gate of the first village, before
which there was an open piece of ground, past a small Hindu
temple surrounded with trees, and up a slight ascent beyond, to a
plain, along which it continued, till it disappeared among the tall
jowaree fields and other cultivation of the next village. These two
villages were called the greater and less Kinny.</p>

<p>The valley, or hollow, was little more than a descent in the undulation
of the country; but, when the rain fell heavily at the
nearer village, so as almost to conceal it, the effect from the
eminence we describe was, as though it were actually deep and
broad; and then also the farther village, with its trees, appeared
distant, and sometimes was not visible at all. Thus alternating,
as sometimes plainly in view, and at others not to be seen, these
villages appeared to be objects of deep interest to three men, who
occupied the spot we have just mentioned. Occasionally, and as
the rain cleared a little, one or other of them would proceed to the
top of a heap of stones near at hand, and look anxiously along
the line of road, past the fields and the open space before the
gate of the first Kinny, up the ascent beyond, and over the plain
to the second; and there were moments when a man on horseback
might easily have been descried even at the further village, certainly
at the second, or between them, had such a person been
upon the road; but no one appeared.</p>

<p>The spot was remarkable as the highest point for a long distance
either way upon the road-track; and indeed, had the day been
clear, a large extent of country could have been seen from it in
all directions. Now, however, the view was very limited; and on
the opposite sides from the two villages nothing could be seen
but a plain, thinly covered with grass and bushes, and strewn
thickly with black stones, which, uncultivated as it was for miles,
looked doubly desolate through the misty air, being partially
covered with pools of water of a yellowish brown colour, the result
of the present rain. Over this plain, three roads or paths diverged
from the place the men occupied. The main track, which had the
appearance of being somewhat beaten, was broader than the others,
and led westward to the town of Allund, about six miles distant,&mdash;the
others to villages from two to four miles to the south and west.</p>

<p>The plain was, as we have said, very stony, and at the place
we allude to, the heap of stones had been formed gradually by
travellers who, coming from all sides, took up one from the path,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
and threw it, with a prayer to the local divinity, upon the pile.
This had been done, no doubt, for centuries; still the stones upon
the path appeared as thick as ever, and sorely impeded and
harassed all travellers, whether on foot or horseback.</p>

<p>Over this heap of stones grew a large banian, and close to it
several scraggy neem trees; a peepul, too, had once existed, but
was dead. Part of the trunk and one large branch remained standing,
white and dry, and a portion of another lay on the ground,
from which chips of firewood had been cut from time to time.
It looked as if it had been struck with lightning, which, indeed,
was not improbable, as several branches of the banian were scathed
and riven, probably from the same cause. Of all these trees, however,
the banian or "burr," as it is called in the language of the country,
was most remarkable.</p>

<p>Not possessed of the luxuriant foliage common to this tree in
other places, probably because the soil was too poor and rocky, its
huge gnarled boughs were bare of small branches and leaves; some
were naked and actually withered, others apparently so, and all
stretched their white gaunt arms into the sky, with a wild and
ghastly effect against the leaden grey of the clouds. In process of
the centuries of its existence, several boughs had become detached
from the parent trunk, and were upheld by stems which had once
been pendant roots, and had struck into the ground. These
portions, if anything more bare, and more gnarled and twisted than
the parent tree, rose loftily into the air, and with the same effect
we have already noticed.</p>

<p>The larger boughs and stems were full of holes, which sheltered a
numerous colony of small grey tree owls, whose bright yellow eyes
stared from behind large boughs, and out of crevices in the trunks,
or from among the ornaments of the roof of the temple below; while
they kept up a perpetual twittering, as if they conversed together,
which indeed perhaps they did. On hot bright days lizards, large
and small, crept out of crevices and basked in the sun; and among
them a family of huge black ones, with bright eyes and scarlet
throats, which they inflated as they appeared to swell with importance.
Shepherd boys believed these to be evil spirits, and if they
were brave, pelted them with stones, or if otherwise ran off, as one
of them issued forth and looked about curiously.</p>

<p>Some large holes, too, near the top of the tree, contained great
horned owls, which, if attracted by any noise, sat, with stupidly-grave
aspect and wide saucer-eyes, looking down upon the road&mdash;the tufts
of feathers over their ears alternately erected and depressed&mdash;till they
flew out with a loud hoot to look for some more undisturbed retreat.
These owls, great and small, with the lizards, had the tree, for the
most part, to themselves. Probably there was not enough foliage to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
tempt other birds to rest there; for except an occasional wandering
flock of chattering parroquets, mynas, or green pigeons, none frequented
it by day. By night, however, it was otherwise: for it was
then the roosting-place of the vultures, eagles, and other carrion
birds of the district, with whom the owls did not apparently interfere.</p>

<p>At the back, partly behind the parent tree and the heap of stones,
was a small and evidently ancient Hindu temple, consisting of one
chamber and a porch. The chamber was not much larger than
sufficed to contain the image, and allow a priest to officiate before it
in case of necessity, and was too low to admit of a man's standing
upright. The porch, which was supported in front by two roughly-hewn
stone pillars, was somewhat larger; and the three men we have
mentioned, were enabled to sit in it comfortably, protected from the
rain. The doorway was narrow and low, and the inside of the
chamber was dark; but a small Phallic emblem could be seen within
set upon a low altar, and a rudely-sculptured stone bull, in a sitting
posture, had originally been placed before the porch facing the image.
The temple, image, and bull showed that the grove had been originally
dedicated to Siva, or Mahadeo, in the form of that ancient
"pillar and calf" worship so fatal to the Israelites of old, and which
for them possessed so strange a fascination.</p>

<p>The temple was deserted, and, except on the annual festival of the
god, when some priest from a neighbouring village swept out the
chamber, brought a light to burn before the image, poured the usual
libations, and hung a few garlands of jessamine and marigold flowers
over it, no one ever came with intent to worship, and the place
was utterly neglected. Last year's garlands were now but dry brown
leaves hanging to a cotton thread; the chamber was dirty, and
strewn with dead leaves; the stone bull in front was overthrown,
and lying on its side, and even in bright sunshine the place presented
a melancholy, deserted appearance. Sometimes, in the heat of the
day, village lads, in charge of goats and cattle, would meet there,
but only in lack of other shelter from the sun; for indeed the spot
had an evil reputation, and not without reason.</p>

<p>It is not surprising that it was believed to be the resort of malignant
spirits which love to dwell in such places, and of tricksy and
mischievous sprites which inhabited the large holes in the old
trunks, sharing them with the owls and lizards that lived there:
vexed travellers' horses, causing them to cast shoes in the stones, or
led wayfarers astray, especially at night, among the many paths over
the stony plain&mdash;or bewitched cows and buffaloes, and dried up their
milk. So, ofttimes, shepherds came with flowers, and poured libations
of milk and curds, after a rude fashion, over a few large stones
which lay among the gnarled roots of the great tree, and had been
placed there as devoted to the local divinities&mdash;Fauns and Dryads&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
therefore held in rude reverence; and these, on such occasions,
were smeared with red or black powder in a kind of deprecatory
worship.</p>

<p>It was not for these reasons alone that the place was dreaded; it
had, from other causes, even a worse reputation. It was notorious as
the place of meeting for most of the gang robberies in the country;
for assemblies of parties of highway robbers, and the distribution of
stolen property. Watchmen on village towers at night, sometimes
saw fires twinkling about the temple, and well knew the cause of
them; and shepherd boys next day found rude clay crucibles and extinguished
charcoal fires in one place where the trunk was hollow
at the root of the tree, and thus knew that gold and silver had been
melted there at night.</p>

<p>Murder, too, had been done there. On one occasion, not very long
ago, several fresh corpses had been found in the old well barely
concealed by leaves and bushes; and, more recently, a body found
lying on the road had been dragged from the line of one village
boundary to another&mdash;for several boundaries of village lands diverged
from that spot&mdash;to escape the king's fine, till it was eaten by vultures
and hyenas, and the bones lay and bleached under the great tree
for many a day, to the terror of all wayfarers. In short, the place
was thus esteemed evil for many reasons; and whether villagers or
travellers came past it by any of the roads over the plain, or from
the two Kinnys, alone or in company, they hurried past the temple,
breathing a spell or prayer against the ghosts and spirits which
dwelt in it, and heartily wishing themselves safe beyond its precincts.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.</a></h2>


<p>The three persons who were sheltering themselves in the porch of
the temple had apparently no apprehensions. Each in turn, throwing
a coarse black blanket about him, mounted the heap of stones
and looked eagerly toward the villages and along the line of road.
The others sat together, rolling up leaves of the banian tree from
time to time, which they filled with tobacco from their pouches, and
smoked as fast as made. All three were heavily armed with long
straight swords with solid basket-handles, from which a spike projected
below the hilt, enabling the wearer to use his weapon double-handed,
as well as to protect the wrist; shields of stout hide, with
brass bosses, hung at their backs, and daggers of different forms
were in their girdles. In the chamber of the temple their three
matchlocks leaned against the wall&mdash;two being ordinary ones with
long bright barrels, the other short and handsomely inlaid with gold,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
evidently of superior value to the others. The men wore their large
crooked powder-horns, and bullet-bags, with tinder-boxes, attached
to soft leather waist-belts, and their priming-horns, hung to the
breast-buckles of their sword-belts, of buff leather. The matchlocks
were ready for instant use; for the matches were lighted, and the
smoke, from the match-ends, and that of a small fire made of dried
twigs, filled the chamber and issued from the door.</p>

<p>The two men who were sitting in the porch&mdash;one had just gone
and taken post again upon the stones&mdash;were stout square-built
fellows, of dark-brown complexion, with peculiarly round powerful
shoulders, which gave them almost the appearance of deformity.
They wore coarse cotton tunics and tight drawers, which reached to
the knee, leaving the lower part of the legs bare, and showing them
to be sinewy and well exercised by constant travel. They had not
removed their sandals, which were strong and studded with large-headed
nails, and, as they sat together, the resemblance in figure was
very striking. They were, in fact, twin-brothers, and, being Mahrattas,
had been named, as is usual, Rama and Lukshmun, after the popular
heroes of the Mahabarut. Even in features there was a strong resemblance;
but the expression of the elder, Rama, was as gloomy, if not
savage, as that of the younger, Lukshmun, was cheerful and good-natured.</p>

<p>The brothers had been long silent, and the third person, who, with
a heavy black blanket thrown over his head, had been sitting for
some time upon the stones, got up and returned to the porch as a
fresh cloud passed overhead, accompanied by heavier rain than before,
which gradually shut out the village and road from his view,
shook the wet from the blanket, and stood looking gloomily at the
sky and the torrents of water which were running off the ground
towards the declivity of the eminence. There was a great contrast
between this person and the others in every respect, and he merits,
perhaps, a separate description.</p>

<p>Though young, he was evidently the leader of the party, and his
comparatively fair complexion and regular features, as well as the
caste-mark on his forehead, showed him to be a Rajpoot, descended
from those emigrants from Northern India whom military service,
even at that period, had tempted from Oude and Delhi to the
remote Dekhan. In stature, as in powerful make, he much exceeded
his companions, and his carriage was soldierlike and graceful. He
wore a quilted tunic of what had once been gay red "mushroo,"
the strong satin of the country, but now stained and frayed; long
tight drawers, turned up to the calf; a dark red turban, of fine texture,
jauntily cocked aside, its gold thread end being turned back
over the top; and his powder-horn, bullet-bag, and shield, as well as
a little gold embroidery upon his sword-belt, all of a better quality<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
than the others, with a fine single pearl ear-ring&mdash;proved him to
be as much superior to them in rank, as his expression and deportment
were in intelligence.</p>

<p>Gopal Singh, for such was his name, was, in truth, decidedly
good-looking. Large black eyes, full of light, a prominent nose,
bushy whiskers, very neatly trimmed, and a small moustache twisted
upwards into close curls at the corners of a mouth delicately
formed and almost effeminate in character when relaxed, but which,
when the lips were compressed, seemed full of deep expression both
for good and evil,&mdash;the chin, clean-shaved and prominent, betokening
firmness,&mdash;all combined to form a countenance in which decision and
energy were evident; but, in spite of his good features, their general
expression was repellant, expressing cruelty and lawlessness of no
common order.</p>

<p>"He will never get across the Benathoora to-day, my friends," he
said, stepping into a dry corner of the porch and sitting down; "and
we have a weary journey to Itga before us in this mud; yet I dare
not face the master, my uncle, without some news of him."</p>

<p>"Maharaj," replied Rama, respectfully, folding his hands&mdash;"Great
prince"&mdash;by which title (an ordinary one of respect), or that of Jemadar,
Gopal Singh was usually addressed by them&mdash;"I know the
Benathoora, and she will not come down before night; and if it
be true that the man left Kullianee yesterday, there is plenty of
time for him to be here by sunset. Depend upon it, he will make
for Allund to-day, and there will have been no deep mud for some hours
after he left. Couldst thou see nothing on the road?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, Rama. At one time I thought I saw him at the gate of
the village yonder, but as the rain cleared off, it was only some cattle
going in; then the mist closed up the view, and I could see no more,
and came away. By Krishna, but this rain is something to see!
I question whether he could cross the nulla down there before
Kinny, it seems filling so fast."</p>

<p>"Ah! he can ford it well enough if he is bent on coming," said
Lukshmun, "and he could not stop at either village, for I told the
Gowra this morning, if a stranger came, to send him on with a
guide, and to shut the gate if he wanted to stop. So, if he left
Kullianee yesterday, he ought to have come a good distance before
night; and if he started again this morning, there is no river, or
nulla, between to stop him but the Benathoora, and that will be
fordable till midnight, even with heavier rain than this. He would
not stay for the rain to clear?"</p>

<p>"He must have left it," returned the Jemadar; "he dared not stay
there. One of old Lukmun Geer's disciples was to accompany him
to a village half-way to Allund yesterday, and send him on from
thence with guides from village to village. We offered escort,
but he would take no one&mdash;the fellow was suspicious."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then he is quite safe, Maharaj. The guides may plague him; but
if he started under injunctions from the old Bawa's disciple, he will
be passed on carefully," returned Rama.</p>

<p>"I hope he is, brothers. I would not lose our chance of the gold
he has for something&mdash;nor indeed of himself."</p>

<p>"Gold! Jemadar," cried both eagerly, in a breath.</p>

<p>"Yes, my friends; good royal mohurs, I know; for the day before
yesterday he rested at the Gosai's Mutt, and had a Hoondee cashed
in the shop. It was a goodly pouchful, I know, and it will come to us
if we wait patiently."</p>

<p>Gopal Singh lighted some tinder with his flint and steel, and then
a leaf cigarette, as we may call it, and began to smoke in silence
which was only broken by the dripping of the rain from the porch of
the temple and the tree, the general plash over the plain, and the
loud and continuous croaking of the frogs in the pools and puddles.</p>

<p>The Jemadar first broke silence. "Some one must look again,"
he continued, after a while; "and it is brighter now. Go thou,
Lukshmun, take the blanket and sit close."</p>

<p>"It is not weather to turn out a dog," muttered the man, sulkily,
getting up and stepping down from the porch; "but I will go,
Maharaj, if it is your order. Shall I go on to Kinny," he continued,
"and see if I can get tidings of him? Better that than sitting up
there like a drenched scarecrow in a field."</p>

<p>"Good, brother, go! Try the nulla before you venture into the
middle of it, lest it be too strong for you," said Rama.</p>

<p>"And wait there for a time," added the Jemadar. "If he do not
arrive before night thou canst bring some flour, ghee, and sugar from
the Patel; for if we are to watch here all night we had need to eat,
and I must make some bread; but if the man comes, bring him on&mdash;he
will be well-mounted and will not fear the nulla, and thou canst
invent something about going back to Allund on urgent business."</p>

<p>"Trust me for that, Jemadar. If I have an ugly face I can speak
soft words when I choose, and I know enough of the camp language
to make him understand. Now, I am going." So saying, he doubled
the blanket in a peculiar manner, so as to form a cloak, threw it
over his head and shoulders, and folded the sides tightly about him;
then taking off his sandals, which he carried in his hand, he strode
away in the rain, as rapidly as the mud would admit.</p>

<p>"Take care of the thorns in the lane near the village; put on your
sandals there: we can't have you troubling us with a Bábool thorn in
your foot," shouted the Jemadar.</p>

<p>Lukshmun turned round and nodded his assent, and continued as
before. They watched him silently till he disappeared over the brow
of the eminence, when Rama said to his companion, "What if they
have sent the man on by the other road, or warned him, Jemadar?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
There was another road which passed about half a mile to the south
of where they sat.</p>

<p>"He dare not, Rama; by his soul he dare not," replied the Jemadar,
with flashing eyes and distended nostrils. "Do you think he
would dare my uncle's vengeance? does he wish his cattle to be harried
by Pahar Singh, and his village burnt?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps not; and it would be likely enough to happen, Jemadar,"
said Rama, laughing; "and, I suppose, we should have to come to do
it. But what is to be done with the man?&mdash;That?" and he pointed
significantly to the old well with his thumb.</p>

<p>"O no, Rama," returned the other, laughing in his turn. "Nothing
of that kind, now. The man himself is precious, why, the
uncle knows, and some more of them, though they have not told me.
I only hope he will not make a fight of it and get hurt."</p>

<p>"Then we could not help it, of course, Jemadar."</p>

<p>"No, indeed, friend. But we are three to one, and he is only a
Mutsuddee after all&mdash;not a man of war&mdash;he will be quiet enough, I
dare say."</p>

<p>"Well, if I am to say the truth, Maharaj, I am glad of it," returned
Rama. "It is all very well to kill people in a fair foray, or if anybody
will fight in a Durôra, one's blood is up, and it does not matter;
but, somehow or other, the last affair here was not agreeable, and ever
since I have not liked the place at night. We need not add to the
people that lie yonder," and he pointed over his shoulder to a corner of
the tree, "unless, indeed, it is to be, then of course we can't help it."</p>

<p>"Nor I either, Rama. It is only pleasant here when there are fifty
or sixty good fellows assembled, and the gold and silver are boiling
in the pots yonder. I don't like this new business as well as the
old&mdash;&mdash;By Gunga, what a flash!"</p>

<p>Indeed the flash of lightning, which caused both to start to their
feet, was nearly blinding. Without warning, except by the passage
of another dark cloud above, it had fallen on part of the old tree
which was separate from the rest&mdash;a branch supported by two
roots which had struck into the ground&mdash;and had riven away part of
it, which fell across the mound of stones with a loud and heavy crash,
and was followed by a cracking peal of thunder, so loud and so near
that the men involuntarily put their hands to their ears.</p>

<p>"It would have killed him if he had been on the stones," said
Rama, who first spoke, as the peal, spreading itself over the heavens,
was dying into deep growls in the distance. "By all the gods! was
there ever such thunder?"</p>

<p>"It will break up the clouds, perhaps," returned the Jemadar,
"and this rain will then stop. Yes, it was a narrow escape, indeed,
and we may be thankful he went. It is a good omen for us,
Rama!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>"I vow a rupee to be inlaid in the floor of the temple of Dévi, at
Tooljapoor, and to feed twenty-four Brahmuns," said the man, reverently.
"Yes," he added, looking up and over the plain, "I think it
will break up before sunset."</p>

<p>But we must follow the spy on his double errand, while the pair,
who still converse, speculate upon the probable issue of it, smoke by
turns, and long for a break in the rain. And there is another person,
too, who must needs be looked after on his journey hitherward.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.</a></h2>


<p>A stout serving-man was holding a powerful grey horse, which, well,
if not handsomely, caparisoned, stood neighing loudly before the door
of an ordinary house in the main street of Surroori, a small village
nearly midway between the towns of Kullianee and Allund, as a
person within, evidently of a superior class, was girding up his waist
with a shawl, and otherwise preparing himself for a day's journey.
Of middle stature, thin but well-proportioned, with a light bamboo-coloured
complexion of a pale cast, and a slight habitual stoop,
the man seemed unaccustomed to rough exertion; and the sword he
had just fastened into his waist-belt, along with an ivory-handled
poniard and knife, was apparently more for ornament than for use&mdash;such
a one as might be used at court, or by a boy,&mdash;not the
weapon of a soldier.</p>

<p>The man's face was clean shaven, except a long moustache, which
drooped very much at the corners, and the features were by no
means ill-favoured. A first glance showed an expression of much
intelligence, mingled, however, as you looked further, with much
cunning. The eyes were small, deep-set under bushy eyebrows,
and of a light grey; the nose high and aquiline, but broad across
the nostrils, and hung over the moustache in a peculiar manner;
the forehead was wrinkled into furrows by habitual elevation of the
eyebrows; and, as far as the upper part of the face was concerned,
it had an appearance of firmness, which the lower portion belied;
for the mouth, drawn up at the corners in a constant and apparently
hypocritical attempt to smile, was evidently performing an office
foreign to its intention; and the chin, which suddenly retreated into
a somewhat bony throat, had no character but decided weakness, if
not, indeed, actual cowardice and deceit. Thus, the whole features
wore a restless, suspicious, and hypocritical expression, which, most
likely, was a true indication of the possessor's mind.</p>

<p>Lalla Toolsee Das was not a native of the Dekhan, but had served
for the last two years, or nearly so, in the Dufter, or Record Office of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
the Emperor Aurungzeeb. The Lalla had been sent from Delhi to
his uncle, who was in the Emperor's service: and, having given
proofs of ability as a Persian scholar, he had been appointed to a
confidential situation about the Emperor himself. What use the
Lalla had made of his position will appear hereafter, as also why
he now undertook a long journey alone, in a strange country, and
at an inclement season of the year. Meanwhile we have only to
describe his progress, which, so far as the weather is concerned,
appears uncertain.</p>

<p>The Lalla had risen early, bathed, breakfasted, and packed his
saddle-bags. He had looked out several times since morning, but
always with the same result as to the sky, which continued of a dull,
leaden grey, with occasional rain. There was no wind, it was close
and hot, and his host, an old Byragee, who was a lay monk of the
Mutt, or monastery, at Kullianee, which the Lalla had left the day
before, was persuading him to remain. But the indifferent night's
rest he had endured from the venomous mosquitoes, the moaning of
a cow over a new-born calf, and other noises from cattle and goats,&mdash;from
the women, who ground at the mill so early in the house,
singing a discordant Canarese song&mdash;and, above all, his personal
anxiety to proceed,&mdash;have weighed against the weather.</p>

<p>"Ah, my poor Mootee," said the Lalla, as he heard his horse
neigh, "thou wilt have a hard day of it, I fear, in the mud. How
far didst thou say it was, Bawa Sahib?" he continued to his host.</p>

<p>"It is six coss, by our reckoning here, by one road&mdash;seven or
eight by the other," replied the Byragee, "which, in the coss you
are accustomed to in Hindustan, will be ten one way, and thirteen
the other."</p>

<p>"And you recommend the longest road, Bawajee?"</p>

<p>"Well, sir, it is as you please. You will have somewhat less
mud and stones by the upper road than by the lower&mdash;that is all."</p>

<p>"Ah, friend," continued the Lalla, as we shall call him, "four coss
more at the end of a hard day is not pleasant, and so the less the
better. Let me see; here is my route. Ah, Kinny, little and great;
I suppose I can rest at either if I like, though I should prefer
getting on to the worthy Fathers' Mutt at Allund."</p>

<p>"Certainly," replied the old man; "but do not stop at Kinny, if
you can help; and, above all, do not shelter yourself at the temple
on the hill, under the 'Burr' tree. Ah, yes, there will be heavy rain
to-day, Lallajee, for it is so hot," he continued, looking up at the
clouds, now deepening into fringes of black here and there; "you
had better stay."</p>

<p>"No, Bawa, I must go on; and if it rains I can't help it. But
about the tree," the Lalla continued; "I suppose there are sprites
and devils in it as usual; and, to say the truth, I am not afraid of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
them. A man that always lives among soldiers, you know, gets
brave."</p>

<p>"Indeed," returned the Byragee dryly. "O, of course! But
take my advice, and when you change guides at Kinny, ask them to
send you by the south road; it's&mdash;it's the best, and some bad places
are avoided. But here is the Patel," he added, as that functionary,
emerging from his doorway opposite, with a striped blanket over his
head and shoulders, saluted the Lalla with a loud "Numascar
Maharaj!" "He will direct the guide himself, Lallajee, which will
insure a speedy and safe journey."</p>

<p>They followed the Patel through the village, which, under the
steadily increasing rain, looked sufficiently wretched to deter any one
from staying, who had not urgent necessity for doing so. This was
not the Lalla's predicament; and he now unfastened a large thick
felt travelling-cloak from the pommel of his cloth saddle, put it over
his head, and wrapped it around him so as to cover his legs, which
were protected by long, soft, Persian riding-boots.</p>

<p>Few people were astir. Under shelter of the house-walls the dogs
had assembled in groups, and, standing with their tails between their
legs, barked at the stranger as he passed. Pigs and fowls, being disturbed
by his horse, ran to and fro, with noisy grunt and cackle.
Some cattle stood together in parties near their owners' houses, a
heavy steam from their nostrils ascending into the thick air, and
broke the silence by an occasional hoarse low. Here and there a
stout motherly dame, with a child seated astride on her hip, and
others hanging about her, stood, nothing abashed, at her house door,
looking at the Lalla as he passed; or a farmer, with his blanket cast
over his head, smoking his morning cigarette, lounged under shelter
of his own eaves, and exchanged a morning greeting with the Patel.
The spouts of terraced houses were beginning to run fast, and small
streams of water were already making their way through the mud.</p>

<p>In the gateway were two or three "jowans," or young men, who
watched and guarded it, and acted as messengers. One of these
was sent for a guide, and the party stayed under shelter till he arrived,
when the Lalla and his bundle were formally made over to him, to
be delivered up at the next village, about two miles distant; and
finally, the Lalla mounted.</p>

<p>"Don't forget the south road from Kinny," said the Byragee,
wishing him a good journey, as the Lalla, making his parting
salutation, rode out of the gateway.</p>

<p>"Who is that?" asked the Patel. "You kept him mighty close
in your Mutt last night."</p>

<p>"I don't know," returned the other; "but he goes on the government
business to Beejapoor, and you know the order which came with
him. I suppose it is some secret matter, else he would have had an
escort."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, he is gone, whoever he is," said the Patel; "and I would
rather he travelled than I, even on that good beast of his, to Allund,
to-day. It is going to rain badly&mdash;but it will do the grain good."
And so they fell to talking of their farms, and the prices of grain
at the last market, while the Lalla and his guide proceeded onward.</p>

<p>If the Lalla could have understood his guide, the way might have
been beguiled by pleasant gossip of the country round; but of the
vernacular of that part of the country he was profoundly ignorant,
and every attempt he made in the "Oordoo," or court language, was
met with a curt "Tillid-illa"&mdash;"don't understand"&mdash;or an occasional
very expressive pantomimic action on the part of the guide, who,
looking back, sometimes pointed to the bundle on his head, then to
the rain, and again tapped his own stomach, or stuffed his fingers
into his mouth, conveying the intimation that he expected to be well
rewarded, and was very hungry. Thus the next village was reached,
the first guide was dismissed with a little extra gratuity, and the
Lalla again proceeded with a fresh one.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>The ranges of low hills crossed from time to time had been stony
but firm ground, and as yet Motee had not suffered. The dreaded
river, which might have cut him off from Allund, was now behind
him; and, after ascending a small eminence, and a wide plain appeared
before him, our traveller congratulated himself on a speedy arrival
at his destination, having, as he considered, got over at least one half
of his journey.</p>

<p>Very soon, however, the rough, stony path changed into one
which at times was difficult to discern at all. The plain over which
the road now lay was cultivated as far as could be seen, but the fields
were as yet unsown. Step after step the mud appeared deeper, the
stones in it more numerous and slippery; and, in fact, after about a
mile, during which the rain had fallen more heavily than ever, the
plain appeared covered with water, which could not run off, and the
black soil of the road and fields to have turned into liquid mud, barely
able to support the stones which lay so thickly upon it. So long,
too, as the rain had not penetrated far below the surface, Motee's
feet had at least the dry earth to rest upon; but now not even that
remained, and yet the gallant horse struggled on, snorting, and
occasionally plunging, but evidently becoming wearied by efforts
which had no respite. Still the guide led on, sometimes by the road-track,
sometimes by its grassy banks, and again leaving both, struck
into other paths through the fields which promised firmer footing.</p>

<p>The rain continued to pour in torrents: indeed, it was more than
ever violent: and a flash of blinding lightning, followed by a roar
of thunder before them, promised worse weather. Poor Motee even
winced, evincing a strong determination to turn round and set his tail
to it; but a few words of encouragement from his master, and being
led a few paces by the guide, restored his temper, and he proceeded
gallantly.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>
<p>At the junction of two roads, the guide paused for a moment.
One, it was clear, led to a village they had seen for some time past,
the trees of which loomed large and heavy through the thick air,
but it appeared out of direction of the path. The Lalla's stock
of Canarese was simply nothing&mdash;of Mahratta not much more; but
the name of his destination was, at least, intelligible. "Allund," he
said, holding out a rupee between his finger and thumb, "Allund!"</p>

<p>The guide grinned as he took the coin. "Allund!" he returned
affirmatively, and striking into a path to the right, the Lalla could
see that, by avoiding the village to the left, the road led apparently
in the direction of what looked like a clump of trees standing out
against the sky. Was that the banian tree of which he had been
warned by the old Byragee at Surroori? The Lalla's little stock of
Mahratta was again put into requisition, and the guide seemed to
understand it readily.</p>

<p>Yes, the village to the left was Little Kinny; that to the right,
great Kinny, and that was the "Burr" tree beyond. Good; then he
had only to avoid the tree, if that indeed were necessary. Since
the peal of thunder the rain had decreased, and a breeze was
springing up in his face, which was very refreshing. The clouds,
too, were breaking, as appeared by patches of bright fringe in the
south-west. The guide pointed to them cheerfully, as he moved on
at a steady pace; for the plain, though muddy in parts, was now not
so bad as what he had already passed. So, as our friend is likely to
reach Kinny without farther trouble, let us see what Lukshmun has
been doing since we left him.</p>

<p>The little rivulet in the valley was above his knees as he passed it,
and, to any one who did not know it, the ford would have been
dangerous; but Lukshmun waded through, without apprehension, and
a few minutes after, as he entered the village gateway and shook the
rain from his blanket, a group of people assembled there welcomed
him with a hearty shout of greeting.</p>

<p>"We thought you would have given it up and departed," said the
old Patel, who, with his son, a few of the village farmers, and the
Putwari, or accountant, were sitting in an open chamber of the deep
gateway, the usual place of business. "We thought you would have
gone away, else I would have sent up some milk. Why did you
not come and sit here, instead of in that ungodly place up yonder?
Here, one of ye," he continued to a group of "jowans," who were
sitting in the opposite chamber, "take his blanket and dry it. Hast
thou eaten to-day, friend?"</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nothing but a bit of stale cake I had in my waist-cloth," replied
the man; "only that my teeth are strong, it would have broken
them. The 'poor man's' bread in the Mutt at Kullianee is not
dainty food, and the flour was musty, O Patel!"</p>

<p>"Take him away to the house, and let them feed him; the women
will have something good, I dare say," replied the Patel. "Go and
see."</p>

<p>"And no one has passed since morning?"</p>

<p>"Not a creature. It is not weather to send the dogs out; and the
mud from Kulmus to Kinny and hitherwards will be hopeless. No,
he won't come to-day; but go and eat, friend&mdash;go and eat."</p>

<p>"If I am wanted," said Lukshmun.</p>

<p>"Jee, jee! Ay, ay! I will not forget you. Go!"</p>

<p>"What does he want out such a day as this?" asked the Putwari.
"What has Pahar Singh in hand just now?"</p>

<p>"What does it matter to us, Rao Sahib?" returned the Patel; "all
we have to do is to keep his people in good humour, to save our cattle
from being harried, our stacks from being burned, and our people,"
he added, looking round at the farmers and their wives, "from
being robbed when they come from market? That is worth what we
pay him. Should we have got the crops off that disputed land at
Chitli if he had not sent those spearmen?"</p>

<p>"No, no; do not interfere," said a chorus of farmers' voices, who,
in those unsettled times, might, unless their village were known to
be under the protection of some local chieftain, at any time have
their flocks and herds swept away by the people of a more powerful
village, or by any of the independent gentry, or barons, as we
may call them, of the country. "What have we to do with state
affairs, or with Pahar Singh either?"</p>

<p>So the assembly having voted non-interference with whatever
might be in hand, our friend Lukshmun was allowed to get his meal
in peace. Smoking&mdash;the impossibility of getting anything&mdash;and a
tight waist-band, had kept appetite down as yet; but with the Patel's
kitchen in prospect, it rose fiercely for the occasion as he approached
the house.</p>

<p>Lukshmun washed his feet and hands before he entered and sat
down. O, what a smell of fried onions there was! and, as a girl set
before him a pile of hot, well-buttered jowaree cakes, a cup full of
"char," or pepper-water with tamarind in it, a fresh leaf full of a
savoury stew of vegetables of all kinds, and some <i>dall</i> or pease-pudding,
well-seasoned with red pepper and garlic, Lukshmun's
heart expanded, and he set to work with a good will. Every now
and then a woman at the fireplace asked him if he would have
more, and it was brought him from the pan, smoking hot. Lukshmun
dallied with each morsel as he ate; and when even reduced by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
repletion to licking his fingers, grudged the summons brought by
a man that he was to come.</p>

<p>"Couldst thou not give me a few cakes, O sweet one, and some
dall?" he said to the good-natured looking wench who had been
serving him. "I have a brother&mdash;hungry&mdash;all day in the rain&mdash;while
I have eaten. Thou art like the moon, O beauty, and thy
heart as soft as butter. Give me the cakes for a poor, weak, hungry
brother."</p>

<p>"Was there ever such a tongue and such a face?" retorted the
damsel, laughing. "Look, Rookmee!"</p>

<p>The cook turned round and looked, too, laughing heartily; for
Lukshmun's attitude on one leg, with the sole of the other foot
pressed against the calf of it, his hands joined and stretched out
imploringly, and his seared face twisted into a grotesque expression
of supplication, was not to be resisted.</p>

<p>"Give him these cakes," said the cook, handing two to the girl.</p>

<p>"By your antelope eyes, O sweet ones, more!" he said, not
altering his posture. "Do you think two would fill a hungry man's
belly? By your lotos feet&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There, begone!" said the cook, handing him a few more and
some dall; "there is a meal for a Rajah. Go, if the mistress
should hear you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am gone, O my beauties," continued Lukshmun, folding the
cakes into his waist-cloth, and tying them behind, then washing his
hands elaborately. "You have made my heart&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Come quickly, come," said a voice at the door; "they want
thee. Wilt thou eat all day?"</p>

<p>"I worship you, lovely nymphs, even as Rama adored&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Begone!" cried both the girls in a breath. "Here is the mistress
coming, and if she hear such nonsense thou wilt be whipped."</p>

<p>"Here is the man who will be your worship's guide," said the
Patel deferentially to our friend the Lalla, who, having arrived
safely, was now divested of his upper clothing, which some of the
men were drying in the opposite chamber, and seated in the place
of honour of the assembly; "but your worship should eat before
you go on, and the Rao Sahib here will take you to his house&mdash;a
Brahmun's house," he added, as the Lalla appeared to hesitate.</p>

<p>"Ah, no, sir," returned the traveller, who indeed was very hungry,
"I could not eat without I bathed, and I had better wait till I get
to Allund. Shookr, shookr! I should be too long about it, and my
horse has had his feed, and is ready to go on. And this is the guide?&mdash;not
beautiful exactly."</p>

<p>"No, Maharaj, I am not beautiful, truly," replied Lukshmun,
with a deprecatory gesture to the Patel, "but I may be useful to
this noble gentleman. You may trust me, my lord. The Patel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
knows me, and so do all these worthy gentlemen; and am I not
come for you?"</p>

<p>"They expect me, then, good fellow," replied the Lalla, amused
by the man's broken Oordoo, and his grotesque expression of face.</p>

<p>"Ah, yes, noble sir," answered the man, joining his hands, "ever
since morning; and as I was coming here on business I was told
to bring you on. And now let us proceed, else it will be night
ere we reach Allund; and," he added, with a wink to the Patel,
"it is not good to be out late on the roads."</p>

<p>"What, are they dangerous, then?" asked the Lalla, looking
anxiously around him.</p>

<p>"O no," cried Lukshmun, interposing readily; "there is no
trouble in the country, and my lord is armed, and so am I. O no,
only in regard to the mud and the stones. My lord will not find the
road long, for I can sing him Mahratta 'lownees' if he likes."</p>

<p>"There was a tree and a temple which I was told to avoid, and to
ask to be sent by the south road," said the Lalla, preparing to mount.</p>

<p>Lukshmun exchanged glances with the Patel and the Putwari.
"Could any one have warned the stranger?"</p>

<p>"A tree!" said the Patel, gravely. "What tree? dost thou know
any, Lukshmun? And the south road? what road?"</p>

<p>"O, I suppose the noble gentleman means that by Navindgee,
and Hoshully, and Chik-Wondully, and Hully Sullgarra," said
Lukshmun, rolling out a volley of hard Canarese village names.
"That road? Why, it is six coss further from here! They should
have sent him by it from Surroori. No," he continued, dropping
the Lalla's stirrup, which he had taken in his hand, "if the gentleman
likes to go he can do so, of course, but his slave begs to be
excused;" and he put his joined hands up to his nose.</p>

<p>"Very good," said the Lalla, "I don't know; only I was told&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"By whom?" interrupted the Putwari.</p>

<p>"By Déo Bawa, the Byragee at Surroori."</p>

<p>"O, the old Bawa!" said the Patel, laughing. "Curious, is it
not, noble sir, that the old man thinks that there are devils in the
tree? He tells me he was bewitched there once, and I ought to
cut it down."</p>

<p>"And I told him I was not afraid of them, Patel; but he said
there was something else," returned the Lalla.</p>

<p>"Robbers, I suppose," said Lukshmun, readily; "Pahar Singh's
men, perhaps."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," added the Lalla, "but he did not say so."</p>

<p>"Well for him," thought the Putwari, "or his stacks would have
been burnt to-morrow night."</p>

<p>"Ah! no fear of thieves when you have one of 'the hunchbacks'
with you," said Lukshmun. "Come, mount, my lord. Salaam,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
Maharaj," he continued, making a mock salutation to the sun, which
was just struggling through a cloud. "Salaam! thou hast been
moist to-day; come out and dry thyself and us too. Now, noble
gentleman, mount, and you will see how fast the excellent dinner I
have eaten in the Patel's kitchen will take my feet to Allund, and
the good horse, too, looks as fresh as if he were but just starting,"
and he patted him. "Ah, well done, sir!" he continued, as the
Lalla mounted not ungracefully; "we poor Dekhanies cannot compare
ourselves on horseback with you northern cavaliers. Come,
sir, the road waits for us."</p>

<p>And with a salutation all round, the Lalla rode out of the gate,
and our friend Lukshmun, cutting a caper which showed his marvellous
activity by way, as he said, of getting the dinner out of his
legs, and calling to the guide who carried the bundle, they passed on
over the village common.</p>

<p>The Putwari sighed as the party left the gate.</p>

<p>"I tell thee, Seeta Ram," said the Patel, "he will come to no
harm, and he is gone away happy."</p>

<p>"I am glad he did not eat at my house; it is not pleasant feeding
a man who has death in his throat," returned the Putwari.</p>

<p>"I tell thee he is safe," retorted the Patel; "and if he is killed, it
is no affair of ours."</p>

<p>"No, it is no business of ours," said the Putwari, settling to his
accounts with a sigh which vexed the Patel. "No, it is no business
of ours," echoed the farmers.</p>

<p>At that time Rama, who was seated on the heap of stones, looking
from the top of the hill, exclaimed, as the three persons emerged
from a lane into a low field in which the road was distinctly visible.</p>

<p>"Jemadar! he is coming at last, and Lukshmun is with him; we
must be ready. Look, they are there!" he continued, as Gopal
Singh joined him, "between the village and the stream."</p>

<p>"Ah, I see them, Rama, and thy brother is as true as gold.
We will join them as they go on; he must not suspect us yet."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII.</a></h2>


<p>Our friend the Lalla was soon at his ease with his new guide, whose
injunctions to Motee, bidding him "take care," "mind a stone," "lift
up his feet," and the like, encouraged the good beast, who now
stepped out briskly, while the curious mixture of Oordoo and
Mahratta, in which the small gossip and scandal of the neighbourhood
was told him by Lukshmun, amused him much. The mile or so
which intervened between the village and the temple was soon passed;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
and as they began to ascend the short rising ground towards the
temple and the tree, the latter could be seen in all its wild picturesque
detail, and was indeed a striking object.</p>

<p>The sun had now broken forth, and its beams shone slantingly
through its rugged trunks and gnarled branches, resting brightly
upon the glossy foliage sparkling with raindrops, and lighting up
every excrescence and furrow of the knotty bark, casting broad
shadows on the road below: while a slight parting shower, the large
drops of which flashed brightly in the air as they descended,
pattered upon the leaves, and spread out into the valley in a silver
rain. As the travellers gained the summit, the clear sky beyond to
the west not only caused the tree to stand out boldly and grandly
against it, but the brightness of the sun dispelled the gloomy
associations which the appearance of the place had suggested during
the rain. A slight breeze, which had hardly been felt in the hollow,
rippled the little pools on the roadway and on the plain beyond the
tree, which, level and stony, continued, apparently many miles, in the
direction they had to go.</p>

<p>Motee paused at the summit of the eminence, and the Lalla could
not help stopping him to look back upon the road by which he had
come. The bright yellow gleams of the sun shone broadly upon
the two villages, and upon the rich green masses of their corn-fields.
In the distance both looked pretty and comfortable: and their
terraced houses, several white temples, and the dome of a small
village mosque shone brightly in the sun. Behind these, and to the
south, the plain over which the Lalla had come stretched away for
many miles, showing the trees of a village here and there, with the
occasional sparkle of a white house or temple among them; and
behind all, the great black cloud of the day's rain, upon which
there was a rainbow forming of great beauty, and against which a
flight of white storks flashed like silver in the sun. Away to the
south, the eye followed hollow and rise, undulation after undulation,
till they were lost in a farther distance, which melted tenderly into
the sky.</p>

<p>"It is a fair country, friend, after all," said the Lalla, "though it
did not look well in the rain. That plain yonder is in the direction
of Beejapoor, perhaps?"</p>

<p>"It is, sir," returned Lukshmun; "that high land, near the sky
yonder, is beyond the Bheema river, and, if we were there, we
should see the tomb of the great Sultan Mahmood, now finished. It
is very grand, sir, and shines like silver when the sun is on it; and
when I go there," continued the man, "I stand like a fool, looking
at the King's palace, the Ark fort, the great gun, and the 'Ibrahim
Roza'&mdash;that's the place where Ibrahim Adil Shah was buried, you
know, sir&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>"Numascar Maharaj," cried a clear manly voice, now beside the
Lalla's horse, which appeared to him to rise out of the earth, for he
had not observed the approach of Gopal Singh and Rama from the
temple.</p>

<p>"Who are these?" exclaimed the Lalla, starting and beginning to
tremble&mdash;"who are these?" and the warning of the old Byragee now
came upon him, with the distressing conviction that he ought to
have regarded it; but it was too late. "Who are ye?" he asked
anxiously.</p>

<p>"O, this is my brother Rama," said Lukshmun, assuringly, "and
that is our Jemadar Gopal Singh; they only waited here while I
went to Kinny."</p>

<p>"Be assured, noble sir," added the Jemadar, laughing, and in
good Oordoo, with a slight southern accent, which seemed to assure
the Lalla, "there is nothing to fear. Your worship is from Kullianee,
perhaps."</p>

<p>"Yes, from Kullianee yesterday."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes, I remember; you were at Poorungeer's Mutt. I was
just about leaving when you arrived, and the old man offered you
escort of my party, but you preferred staying."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;had business," replied the Lalla, stammering, not
exactly relishing Gopal Singh's bold looks, and yet unable to object
to him. "I was tired and needed rest, and you could not wait."</p>

<p>"You had come from the royal court, I think they said, and
were going to Beejapoor with letters for the King&mdash;proposals for
peace, perhaps."</p>

<p>"So they said&mdash;who?" Of all things, the Lalla supposed his
destination and business were at least secret; yet they appeared
known, and to a perfect stranger, too, by the wayside. He did not
feel able to reply, and was almost inclined to trust to Motee's speed,
and break through the men; but Lukshmun, on receiving his
matchlock from his brother, fixed the match, which had been
hanging loose upon the cock, in a very precise manner, pressing the
trigger to see if the match descended upon the pan. The others,
too, looked carelessly to the priming of their guns, but to the
Lalla's idea ominously, and as if he should understand the action.
Lukshmun's face, too, appeared changed&mdash;it was not so pleasant as
it had been.</p>

<p>"Come," said the Jemadar, "we have far to go to-night&mdash;what
kept thee so long, Lukshmun?"</p>

<p>"O, the Patel at Kinny said we were to escort this worthy
gentleman, as government orders had come about him from Allund;
so I waited, as the rain had delayed him."</p>

<p>The Lalla felt reassured; his arrival was no doubt expected.
"Ah, yes, sir," continued Gopal Singh, "you had better have come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
on with us three days ago, but it does not matter now. That is a
fine horse of yours," he added, patting Motee's neck, "and from
Hindustan, I think, as my lord is. We, too&mdash;that is, my family&mdash;are
also from thence, Kanouj Khutrees; so is this good gun, too;"
and he held out his own. "Yes; one can hit a man on horseback
at full speed half as far as to the stream yonder."</p>

<p>It appeared to the Lalla as if the Jemadar was reading his
thoughts as clearly as if he were telling them himself.</p>

<p>"And if we were in battle," he continued, "and any one were
trying to get away from me, he would be shot between the shoulders
before he could even reach the tree yonder."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;have no doubt of it, Jemadar Sahib," returned the Lalla,&mdash;"no
doubt: and your speech is pleasant to hear after the rough
language hereabouts."</p>

<p>"Come, come," cried Lukshmun, with seeming impatience, "if
you want to pay compliments, noble sir, wait till we get to the
end of our journey. Come!" and as he spoke he touched Motee's
rein. "Come on, my son!" he said, and the horse followed.</p>

<p>As they passed the little temple in its loneliness under the shadow
of the huge tree, it looked a place for evil deeds. A large horned
owl on the highest branch, now awakening for his evening flight,
hooted loudly above them, and was answered by another. It
seemed an evil omen, and struck to the Lalla's heart.</p>

<p>"Ah! we cannot pass you, my friend," said Gopal Singh. "Look,
Lalla Sahib, what my gun can do."</p>

<p>As he spoke, he raised the piece and fired. The aim was true and
deadly, and the huge bird fell down heavily close to Motee's feet
with a rushing sound, causing the horse to start back.</p>

<p>"I never miss," said the man, decidedly, and reloading his piece.
"Now come on."</p>

<p>"Shabash! Well shot," said the Lalla; but his heart was
throbbing fast, and it was a positive relief to him when the dark
grove was behind them, and they emerged upon the bare, wild, open
plain beyond.</p>

<p>"A lonely place that, Jemadar," remarked the Lalla, turning to
the man who walked behind him; "and the old Byragee, where I
slept, advised me not to go by it; he said Pahar Singh's men might
be about. Who is this Pahar Singh?"</p>

<p>"Pahar Singh?" returned the Jemadar. "O, a worthy gentleman
who is quiet enough when not plagued. He is the lord of the
marches hereabouts&mdash;a valiant man, and a good soldier; and in
these troubled times, Lallajee, has his friends and his enemies, like
most of us: 'tis the way of the world."</p>

<p>After another mile, during which none of the party spoke, the
Jemadar proposed to the Lalla to dispense with the guide. "Evening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
was drawing on," he said; "they knew the country, and the
contents of the bundle could be carried on the saddle or divided
among them;" and, indeed, it appeared necessary, as the guide, limping,
declared he could go no farther, and had a thorn in his foot.
The necessary arrangements were soon completed; and, between
the Lalla's saddle-bags and his saddle, the contents of the bundle were
soon disposed of; the guide received a small gratuity, and retraced
his steps at a far more rapid pace than he had advanced.</p>

<p>"He has no more a thorn in his foot than I have, Lalla Sahib,"
said the Jemadar, laughing. "Look how he goes! but Bheema
there is no worse than his fellows, and does not like the idea of a
night journey without change. Now we shall get on better. Let
the horse walk out, Lukshmun; only keep by him."</p>

<p>Lukshmun let go the rein, but he did not leave his place, and though
the rate at which the horse now proceeded kept the men at a rapid
walk, and occasionally, indeed, at a trot, they preserved the positions
they had taken up without alteration, speaking little among themselves,
except occasionally in Mahratta or Canarese, with both of
which languages they appeared familiar.</p>

<p>The sun was setting in great glory. After the heavy clouds had
passed away to the eastward, a clear blue sky succeeded for a while;
but as a gentle breeze arose, it had brought up with it light, fleecy
vapours, which, as the wind again died away at sunset, became
motionless, and, gradually attracted to each other, formed piles of
white clouds edged with deep grey. As the sun declined, white
became orange and gold and crimson: while the sky itself, of an
intense purple above, faded into green, yellow, and rosy tints, on
which the golden clouds seemed to float in soft but brilliant masses:
and, as it dipped below the horizon, a flood of light suddenly shot
up, tinging the lower edges of all the lighter portions with vivid
scarlet, and mingling with the deep orange and purple hues above,
gorgeously.</p>

<p>"The gods have a festival upon Mount Méru to-night, Lallajee.
Does the sun go down in that fashion in your country?" said the
Jemadar, pointing to the sky and breaking a long silence. "We
have made good work of it since the guide left us. Come, here is a
little stream, and you need a change of posture; dismount and rest,
while I offer my evening libations to the four elements."</p>

<p>"No, I will not dismount, Jemadar," returned the Lalla; "you
will not be long, and by all means let your men get a drink of water
too, and wash their feet. I will stay here."</p>

<p>"He is not to be trusted," said the Jemadar to his men in
Canarese; "I see it in his eyes. If he stirs, shoot him, and both of
you stay by him."</p>

<p>Rama had fastened one of the horse's tether-ropes about his waist,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
and he now proceeded to tie the end of it to the cheek-strap of the
bridle in a methodical manner.</p>

<p>"What are you doing?" cried the Lalla, alarmed at the action;
"loose it!"</p>

<p>"O, my lord will dismount," said Lukshmun, "and who is to
hold the horse?"</p>

<p>"I am not going to move: loose it, I say!" cried the Lalla, impatiently.</p>

<p>But Rama sat down doggedly at a little distance, holding the
rope, and began deliberately to munch a cake his brother had unfastened
from his back, resting his gun across his knees.</p>

<p>"Loose it!" again cried the Lalla, "Jemadar, why have I been
tied like a thief?"</p>

<p>The Jemadar had divested himself of his upper clothing and
stepped into the stream; he was taking up water in his hands and
pouring it to the four quarters of the earth. His clothes and arms
were on the river bank.</p>

<p>"There is no use in disturbing him, Maharaj," said Lukshmun,
quietly; "he is at his prayers, and can't hear. My brother, you see,
doesn't understand you, and he only does what the Jemadar told
him; so get off and walk about a little. Come, I will hold the
stirrup for you."</p>

<p>"No; loose the rope!" cried the Lalla again, eagerly, and reaching
over to do so himself.</p>

<p>"Ah, Maharaj! you must not do that; you see my brother will be
angry. I advise you to be quiet," said Lukshmun, putting back the
Lalla's hand, and pulling the knot of the rope firmer.</p>

<p>But the Lalla could not now contain himself; his alarm was
gradually increasing. He thought he could break away from the
men, and dash through the stream ere they could fire at him.
Touching Motee with the bridle and his heel at the same time, he
aroused him from the sluggish position he had assumed, and moved
him a little so as to face Rama, who still sat eating; and the Lalla
was quietly gathering up the reins preparatory to urging the horse
forward, when the keen practised eyes of the men detected the intention.
Excited by his rider, the horse gathered himself on his
haunches and made a bound; but Lukshmun, leaping at the bridle,
hung on to it, jerking it back so violently that the horse reared, while
the Lalla, whose right arm had been seized by Rama, lost his
balance, and fell heavily to the ground.</p>

<p>Hearing the cries of the men, Gopal Singh had run from the
stream hastily, taking up his sword, and reached the spot as the
Lalla fell.</p>

<p>"Get up!" he cried, seizing his arm; "what folly is this? By
the gods, he has fainted! Thou hast not used thy knife, Rama?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not I, Jemadar; but he fell heavily. What could I do? He
would have been off, for the horse is a strong beast, and I could
hardly hold him&mdash;only for the old trick. Get some water, Jemadar,
he will drink from thee. I will hold him up. Stay, here is his lota."</p>

<p>While the Jemadar ran for water, Rama knelt down and raised
the Lalla's head, who now opened his eyes. "Speak to him,
Lukshmun; tell him to get up and be quiet," said Rama to his
brother.</p>

<p>"Do you hear, Maharaj? you are to get up and be quiet. Rama
says so," cried Lukshmun, "and he is not a child."</p>

<p>"Nor I, Lalla," said the Jemadar, returning with the water. "By
Krishna, what made thee vex the hunchbacks? they were likely to
be rough enough if provoked. Art thou hurt?"</p>

<p>"No, my lord&mdash;that is, valiant sir&mdash;only a little," replied the Lalla,
moving his body about to ascertain the fact. "No; but my life!&mdash;O
spare my life!&mdash;do not kill me."</p>

<p>"I am more hurt than he is, Jemadar," said Rama, rubbing his
arm, "for he fell on me. Ah, you rascal!" he continued with a
Mahratta oath, "only for the Jemadar there I had settled accounts
with thee; get up!"</p>

<p>"I petition," said Lukshmun, who led up Motee, now calmed, "as
the Lalla broke faith with us, that he walks; and Rama rides, as he
is hurt."</p>

<p>"Ah, by your heads, no!" exclaimed the Lalla; "I never could
walk a coss in my life; and my feet would never go over these stones
and briars. Kill me, if ye will, but walk I cannot."</p>

<p>"Tie him up," suggested Rama, "if he can't walk; we must not
trust him in the dark on that good horse."</p>

<p>"A good thought," said the Jemadar; "give me his sheet from
the saddle."</p>

<p>The Lalla guessed what had been said, and protested and resisted
vehemently; but he was as a child in the hands of the men, and in
a few moments his hands and arms were swathed to his body gently
within the sheet, but so that he could not use them: and he was
raised to his feet, trembling violently, while the bandage was
fastened behind him.</p>

<p>"Ah, sir! do not shake so," said Lukshmun, smiling, and joining
his own hands in mock supplication; "if you do, you will go to pieces,
and there will be none of you left when we get to our uncle, Pahar
Singh."</p>

<p>Pahar Singh! the Lalla's heart sank within him. But he had no
time for remonstrance. He was lifted like a child into the saddle,
the men resumed their arms and positions, and again set forward.</p>

<p>"Where are you going to take me, Jemadar?" asked the Lalla,
trembling, as they crossed the stream. "Ah, be merciful to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>"So you have got speech at last," returned Gopal Singh. "Listen,
Lalla, if you had been quiet you should have ridden like a gentleman,
now you go as a thief. Pahar Singh, my uncle, is lord of these
marches, and knows what to do with you. One thing, however, I
may tell you; if you make any further attempt to escape, I will
shoot you. It is not your carcass that he wants, but what you have
on it; the gold you got at Kullianee. Now, beware, for you know
the worst."</p>

<p>Of what use was resistance, and the Lalla clung to life. They
might take his gold. There remained, at least, the papers he possessed;
and if he begged his way on foot to Beejapoor, what matter,
so that he got there with them?</p>

<p>So they proceeded as rapidly as the ground would admit, still
continuing to avoid all villages by paths through the fields, with
which they seemed perfectly acquainted.</p>

<p>Before they reach their destination, which they will do in two or
three hours more, we may describe the person to whom they are proceeding.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.</a></h2>


<p>As at the banian tree, when Lukshmun was guide, and the Lalla
had ridden up the rising ground, the sun had shone out brightly
with a broad gleam through its giant trunks and branches, and
over the villages and corn-fields beyond; so about the same time
the light, glittering through the watery particles which filled the air,
spread over a rich landscape, as viewed from a height above the
pretty village of Itga, whence, by a rough stony path, a company
of horsemen were now proceeding to the village itself.</p>

<p>There might have been twenty-five to thirty men, from the youth
yet unbearded to the grizzled trooper, whose swarthy sunburnt face,
and large whiskers and moustaches touched with grey, wiry frame,
and easy lounging seat on his saddle&mdash;as he balanced his heavy
Mahratta spear across his shoulders&mdash;showed the years of service
he had done. There was no richness of costume among the party;
on the contrary, the dresses were worn and weather-stained, and of
a motley character. Some wore thickly quilted white or chintz
doublets, strong enough to turn a sword-cut; or ordinary white
cotton clothes, with back and breast pieces of thick padded cloth,
or light shirts of chain-mail, with a piece of the same, or twisted
wire, folded into their turbans; and a few wore steel morions, with
turbans tied round them, and steel gauntlets which reached to the
elbows, inlaid with gold and silver in delicate arabesque patterns.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>The caparisons of their horses were as shabby as the dresses; but
some had once been handsome, with embroidered reins and cruppers,
and gay muslin martingals. All were now, however, soiled by the
wet and mud of the day. It was clear that this party had ridden
far, and the horses, though excellent and in high condition, were,
from their drooping crests and sluggish action, evidently weary.
Four of the men had been wounded in some skirmish, for it was
with difficulty they sat their horses: and the bandages about them,
covered with blood, showed the wounds to have been severe. But
the sight of the village appeared to have revived the party; the
horses were neighing and tossing their heads, and the men, shifting
their places in the saddles, pointed eagerly to it, or, brandishing
their spears, shouted one to another, cheering up the wounded men.</p>

<p>Among these horsemen, as also over the valley below, the sun's
gleams shone brightly, casting long irregular shadows over the
ground as they moved, and, glinting from spear-head, morion, and
steel armour as the men swayed in their saddles, lighted up faces of
varied character, all now joyous, but wearing an expression of
habitual recklessness and lawless excitement.</p>

<p>Below them, at less than half a mile's distance, was the village
itself. In the centre of it, or rather more to the right hand, was
a high square castle, with round bastions at the corners, having
loopholed parapets, which, where it had not been wetted by the
rain, was of a warm grey, the colour of the mud or clay of which
it had been built. It was in perfect repair, and the close smooth
plastering of the walls and parapets showed that the weather was
not allowed to injure it.</p>

<p>Inside the castle walls were the white terraced roofs of a dwelling-house,
and in the bastions in the east and north corners several
windows and other perforations in the curtain walls, which showed
that rooms were connected with them; but it was clear, from the
height of the parapets above the ground, which might be sixty feet,
that most of the inside must be a solid mass of earth, as indeed
it was as far as the courtyard, around which were the houses
already noticed. On one high bastion, in which several small
cannon were placed, was a flagstaff, and a large white flag, bordered
with green, which floated out lazily upon the evening breeze,
showing the device&mdash;a figure cut out in red cloth and sewn upon
the white&mdash;of the monkey god Hunoomán, who might be supposed
to be, as he was, the tutelary divinity of the castle.</p>

<p>To protect the gateway there was a double outwork with several
narrow traverses and large flanking bastions, but otherwise no
additional defence to the castle walls, which were quite inaccessible.
Around their foot, separated only by an open courtyard, surrounded
by a low wall with bastions at intervals, were the terraced houses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
of the place, thickly placed together, and filling up the space
between the outer wall of the village and the castle itself. There
was no doubt that the community living there was thriving, and
better protected than those of the more open villages of the country.
The houses, too, were of a superior and more substantial character,
and gave assurance of habitual safety and wealth.</p>

<p>Outside all, ran a high wall, also of mud, with large round
bastions at intervals, loopholed and mounted with jinjalls, and
other wall-pieces, with two large gates, each defended by an
outer work and traverse, and heavy bastions on each side; and
there were several smaller wickets or posterns, each with a parapet
wall before, and a tower beside it. The whole formed a very strong
position, impregnable against any attack by marauding horse; and
even in the event of a siege by a better organized force, it could
have held out stoutly.</p>

<p>The ground for some distance round Itga formed a clear natural
esplanade, over which it was impossible for anything to advance
without being seen from the castle walls. This was now like a
carpet of emerald green, on which fell the broad shadows of the
tall trees near the gates and a grove round a small Hindu temple,
and several large herds of cattle rested or browsed before entering
the village walls for the night. Beyond the open ground the
irrigated fields and gardens of the village commenced; and the
bright yellow green of the sugar-cane, in large patches, catching
the sun's rays, glowed among the darker colours of the grain crops
and cotton, which spread up and down the valley as far as could
be seen, and on both sides of the stream flowing in the centre.</p>

<p>Above the village the valley appeared to contract gradually, and
the stream to disappear behind a projecting bluff. Below, it opened
out considerably; and could be seen for several miles, showing
other villages in the distance, with their ghurries, or castles, of the
same character as that of Itga, but smaller, rising above the trees;
while, here and there, the white dome of a mosque, or steeple of
Hindu temple, with portions of the stream, sparkled in the evening
sun.</p>

<p>A fair scene now when, over the rich crops and gardens, and
spreading over the tender distance, the bright evening light threw
a mellow radiance, resting with brilliant effect upon the projections
and bastions of the castle, upon the terraces of the houses, the
heavy gateways, the people passing to and fro, and the bright-coloured
cattle upon the village green. A fair scene, truly, and in
strong contrast with the character of the place, which, to say the
truth, was evil enough in some respects.</p>

<p>The owner of this village, and of several adjoining villages, was
the Pahar Singh, whom, casually, we have already had occasion to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
mention. Nominally a frontier officer of the Beejapoor State,
"Hazaree," or commander of a thousand men, and holding the
estate in maintenance of a troop of horse and a number of foot
soldiers, which, though somewhat less, passed for a thousand in the
royal musters of Beejapoor,&mdash;Pahar Singh had by no means
followed his father's example of steady devotion to his duty, or
confined his men to the purpose for which they were intended.
During his father's lifetime he had engaged with the most dissolute
and lawless of his father's retainers in border raids and forays
without number, and had not unfrequently defied the troops of the
State, bringing his father's good name into very questionable repute.</p>

<p>After the old man's death, wilder times ensued, when a bold
stroke, here and there, decided a man's fortune; and proportionately
as he was powerful or otherwise locally, his influence, both at court
and in the provinces, extended. Pahar Singh had struck many
such, with which, however, we have no concern. Following the
example of the Beydur chief of Sugger, he had imposed a system
of black-mail all over the frontier near his estate, which, if not
regularly paid, was enforced roughly enough; while, on his part,
his clients were protected from violence by other parties. The
system, in fact, extended to the capital itself, and merchants and
rich travellers paid Pahar Singh's dues as the best means of escaping
outrage if they had to travel across his marches.</p>

<p>To others but his own people, Pahar Singh was a merciless
savage, for the most part; and even his own relations, and those
who knew him best, could hardly account for the variation of
temper which could watch torture for the extortion of money&mdash;perhaps
an agonized death&mdash;at one moment, and at the next listen
to a tale of distress, or need, or sickness, and relieve it himself, or
send it to his wife Rookminee, with a message which insured
prompt attention from that kind lady.</p>

<p>It is perhaps unnecessary to go far back into history for illustrations
of character like that of "the Hazaree." Such still exists
among the native states of India, and even among our own subjects,
restrained by the power of the paramount Government, if not by
the spirit of the times&mdash;but still restrained&mdash;from lives as reckless
and lawless, from savagery as deep and as unrelenting, as was that of
Pahar Singh. With such characters, evil passions have taken the
form of sensuality in its varied phases, which, as mostly concerning
the individual himself, blunts the exercise of all finer feelings, but
does not occasion the misery to others which would be the result of
unfettered and misguided action.</p>

<p>The party we have mentioned had descended the small pass from
the tableland above, and had pressed merrily on to the village gate,
where they were met by friends, and welcomed by many a rough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
but kind greeting, and by a discharge of wall-pieces from the
bastions, and shots from the castle, answered by the matchlocks
of the party. Having entered the deep arched gateway, they were
now emerging irregularly from its shadow into the main street,
down which the sun streamed brightly. The terraced houses were
covered with women and children waving cloths, or whatever they
could catch up. The shopkeepers, for the most part, descended
from their seats and exchanged respectful greetings with the leader;
and as the small troop passed up towards the open space below the
castle, still firing shots, it was plain that every one had forgotten the
fatigue of the march in his safe return.</p>

<p>The horsemen remained mounted after the halt, and several stout
serving-men took the heavy bags of money which each in succession
loosed from his saddle-bow, and carried them into the castle. This
done, the leader dismounted, and the chief "Karkoon," or scribe,
delivered a short but pleasant message from the chief, and dismissed
the rest; and the men, wheeling round, discharged an irregular
volley from their matchlocks, and, passing back round the foot of
the outer bastion of the court, separated, each to his own house.</p>

<p>"He will not delay you long," said Amrut Rao, the Hazaree's
chief Karkoon, or scribe, to the leader; "but you are not to go, he
says, without seeing him."</p>

<p>"What temper is he in?" asked the person addressed.</p>

<p>"Not good&mdash;but no fear for you. He is angry at Gopal Singh's
absence, that is all; so be careful, Maun Singh, and do not cross
him to-day. Come, he has looked for you these many hours."</p>

<p>Maun Singh, an active, intelligent man, with a bright soldierly
bearing, was a cousin of the chief, and a valuable and trusty leader
of partisan expeditions. This foray had been remarkable for its success.
A convoy of treasure, belonging to the neighbouring kingdom
of Golconda, had been attacked on its way to the capital, its escort
defeated, and the money for the most part secured and brought in.
The largest portion of the force was returning by a different road;
this, consisting of picked men and horses, had pressed on home with
the booty.</p>

<p>Maun Singh entered the gate with his companions, and ascended
an inclined plane leading to a court above, which, the outer one of
the interior of the castle, was that to which men were alone allowed
access. On two sides were open verandahs, consisting of double
rows of wooden arches, supported upon carved pillars, the floor of
the inner one being raised a little above that of the outer. On the
east side, a large chamber of some pretension, ended in an oriel
window, fitted with delicately carved shutters, which admitted light
and air. This chamber was three arches in depth, and the wood-work
of the pillars was carved in bold designs of flowers and leaves,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
the ends of the beams being fancifully cut into dragons' heads, the
lines of which were carried gracefully into the general patterns of
flowers and leaves. This was the chamber, or hall, of audience.</p>

<p>On the fourth side of the court was a stable, and a door which led
to servants' rooms and offices, and there were folding-doors in the
verandahs on both sides communicating with women's apartments,
and stairs leading to the roofs of the buildings which formed the
parapets for defence of the castle.</p>

<p>As he entered the court, Maun Singh greeted, and was saluted in
turn by, those around; and a party of scribes, engaged in accounts
at the entrance of the hall, rose at his approach. Passing these, he
went on to his relative, who was sitting reclined against a large
pillow in a recess of the window, and who half rose as he returned
his salutation, but not courteously.</p>

<p>Pahar Singh was always remarkable&mdash;no one could look on him
unmoved. He had a strong-featured hard face, prominent aquiline
nose, deep-set black eyes, not so large, as penetrating in character,
and covered by bushy eyelashes. The eyes were restless and unsettled
in character, and, by this, and the general expression of his
countenance, he was nicknamed the falcon. None of the hair on
his face was shaved, and the whole was tied up in a knot and wound
round his head in a thick heavy mass, while the thin grey and
sandy-coloured beard and moustaches, divided in the centre, were
usually passed over each ear, but could, if he pleased, be worn flowing
down to the waist. The forehead was high and covered with
deep wrinkles, and upon it the veins from the root of the nose stood
out roughly and with a knotted appearance, apparently the result of
habitual excitement. The mouth had hard cruel lines about it, and
the sinewy throat tended to increase the rugged character of the
whole countenance.</p>

<p>In age he appeared past forty. Naked to the waist, his figure was
wiry, and showed great power, particularly in his arms. Pahar
Singh's strength was proverbial in the country; and the large exercising
clubs, standing in a corner, which he used several times during
the day, could be wielded by none but himself.</p>

<p>"I received your letter, Maun Singh," he said, before that person
was seated. "Why did you delay? Why did you let that boy
leave you? By Gunga, if the boy dies, or comes to hurt, your life
shall answer for it."</p>

<p>"Pahar Singh," replied the other, who always addressed his
cousin by name if he were angry, and who had less fear of him than
any one else, "I have done good work. There are more than
twenty thousand rupees yonder, and I have only lost one man."</p>

<p>"True, true, brother," cried the chief, waving his hand; "there is
no blame for that, only for the boy. What took him to Kullianee?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>"I sent him to Poorungeer, the banker, with the bills, to see if
any were negotiable. There he heard of something; and when all
was quiet at Muntalla, he departed at night without my knowledge.
He only left word that he had gone after some good business, and
was not to be followed."</p>

<p>"Wrong, Maun Singh. Thou wert wrong not to watch him&mdash;not
to send men after him. If he dies, O Maun Singh, O brother, it
were better thou wert never born!" and the chief smote his pillow
angrily with his clenched fist.</p>

<p>"His fate is not in my hand, Pahar Singh," retorted the other;
"and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do you answer me? do you answer me?" cried the chief,
savagely grasping the pillow, the veins of his forehead swelling and
his nostrils dilating as he spoke.</p>

<p>Amrut Rao knew the sign, and interposed. "Is this money to be
counted?" he said, pointing to the bags; "if so, give me the key of
the treasury, and let the Jemadar go home. He is tired, and you
will like to see the coin. It shall be counted before you."</p>

<p>"Good! Go, Maun Singh. I shall be quieter when you return,"
replied the chief. "Ah, yes! we were once the same, brother. We
could not be stopped either," he said more gently, "if we had anything
to do."</p>

<p>"The hunchbacks are with him, and they are all on foot, brother,"
returned Maun Singh: "fear not; but if thou art restless, give me
some fresh men and a fresh horse, and we will ride round the villages."</p>

<p>"No; go home&mdash;go home. No; let him hunt his own game,"
returned the chief.</p>

<p>"But about the money? Déo Rao wants to get home now, for he
is starving," interposed the Karkoon.</p>

<p>"Let him go then!" exclaimed the chief tartly.</p>

<p>"No, he can't go till it is counted," retorted Amrut Rao.</p>

<p>"It need not be counted."</p>

<p>"It must be counted, Maharaj! If there is a rupee wrong we
shall never hear the last of it. The bags have never been opened&mdash;who
knows what is in them?"</p>

<p>"It may be gold, Amrut Rao. Come, who knows? yes, who
knows? Come," exclaimed Pahar Singh excitedly.</p>

<p>Few could take the liberties in speech with the chief that were
permitted to Amrut Rao, and even he was not always successful;
but now the Suraffs, or money-changers, sent for had arrived, and
Pahar Singh watched the opening of every bag with an almost
childish curiosity. All anxiety for his nephew had departed before
the sight of money. Yet Gopal Singh was the life and stay of the
house; precious as Pahar Singh's heir, and more so as the husband
of his daughter, who was as yet a child.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>"Good coin, good coin!" cried the chief exultingly, as the contents
of the bags passed through the experienced hands of the
examiners without one being rejected. "Good coin! O Amrut
Rao, I vow all the light weights to feed Brahmuns. Dost thou
hear?"</p>

<p>"I am afraid their bellies will be empty enough," returned the
Karkoon, laughing. "No, Maharaj! do better: send five hundred
to Vyas Shastree to offer at the shrine of Sri Máta if Gopal Singh
returns safe to-night. You cannot disappoint her and be secure."</p>

<p>"Well spoken! well spoken! Yes, put the money aside; yes,
put all the light-weight coin and make it up; thou shalt have it&mdash;if&mdash;he
comes. Holy Gunga! what is that?" he exclaimed, suddenly,
as a separate bag rolled out of one then being emptied.
"Gold, by all the gods! Give it me; I will count it myself."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.</a></h2>


<p>We must, however, return to our travellers, whose progress since
night set in had been anything but agreeable, considering the state
of the road; for though the light-footed men traversed it easily,
poor Motee, weary enough, stopped fairly where the mud was
deepest, and quivered in every limb in the intervals of stony
ground. Indeed, he would have given up long ago but for Lukshmun,
whose cheery voice and hand, now soothing, now encouraging,
now remonstrating, urged him to put forth his whole power; and
as if the promises of a good stable, the sweetest fodder, the best
grain, which were repeated with every endearing variation that
Mahratta and Canarese, oddly intermixed with scraps of Oordoo
ballads, could supply, seemed to be understood by the gallant beast
as he toiled on. His master, since he had been swathed up in the
sheet, and had found it impossible to help himself, had fallen into
what might be called a passive frame of mind. Nothing was clear
to him, neither where he was, nor with whom or where he was
going.</p>

<p>As before, villages were avoided, and it was evident that his
guides knew the country perfectly&mdash;threading lanes, then emerging
into open fields, again crossing waste ground, but still preserving, as
nearly as possible, the same direction, as the Lalla could see by the
moon which, struggling through masses of watery clouds that had
risen since sunset, threw a misty and indistinct light upon the path
and what lay in its immediate vicinity. Now and then they approached
so near a village that the watch-dogs within its walls
bayed and howled, and they could hear the hum of voices, or see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
lights high up in the ghurry, or the watch-towers at the gates; but
they did not stop. All the Lalla asked occasionally was, "How far
yet?" and received but one answer&mdash;"Coss bur." The trees of
village after village, and the dark square forms of their ghurries, or
castles, stood out against the moon in succession, and each one he
hoped might be the last; but still they went on, through the same
apparently endless succession of muddy lanes, and over open fields
and waste lands,&mdash;faster if the ground were firm, slower if it were
muddy.</p>

<p>Finding it of no use to speak to his companions, the Lalla's mind
reverted naturally to his own condition, and was as busy now,
though after a more dreamy fashion, than in the morning, when
riches and honours seemed within his grasp. For after some misgivings
he had argued himself into a belief of a positively agreeable
reception by Pahar Singh. He would not at once admit his errand
to the Beejapoor court, but reserve it for a confidential communication;
and he would be able to tell Pahar Singh about their own
country. Yes&mdash;the Lalla had framed, and was framing, many irresistibly
polite speeches in his mind, recalling verses to quote from
Persian poets, and the replies to his remarks would necessarily be in
a similar strain. What else could be expected of one of his own
countrymen? and he would make allowances for some omissions in
strict etiquette and courtesy. Then what excellent cookery he
should enjoy&mdash;what luxurious rest!</p>

<p>Alas! these were but the delusions of hunger, thirst, and weariness,
and were but shortlived; for in their place would suddenly
arise a ghastly anticipation of violence&mdash;a dungeon and chains&mdash;ending
in a lingering or sudden death. Or, again, the loss of all
his papers and his money&mdash;both as yet safe. Or, perhaps, of being
again taken to the royal camp, and sold to the Emperor, a hasty
doom following&mdash;an elephant's foot, or <i>that</i> executioner, always
present, whom he so well remembered.</p>

<p>There was no denying that such thoughts would recur more
vividly than the others, causing the Lalla to writhe in his bonds,
and to break out into a cold sweat from head to foot, in, as it were,
the very bitterness of death. This past, he would sink once more
into apathy and weariness, while Motee groaned, trudged, and
splashed, or Lukshmun cheered or warned him; and the two
others, in their old places, their lighted matches glowing in the
darkness, never varied in position or in pace.</p>

<p>It might have been the close of the first watch of the night,
perhaps more, when the Lalla became sensible of a change in the
demeanour of the men. They talked more among themselves, and
laughed heartily. Gopal Singh even told him to be of good heart.
The road, too, was more open and less muddy. Before him was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
rising ground, and upon it a tree distinctly visible against the moon,
to which they pointed, and stepped out at a better pace. As they
neared the tree they halted for a moment, shook out their dresses,
resettled their turbans, and rubbed up their moustaches. Yes, they
were most likely near the end of their journey, but the Lalla dare
not ask; his tongue was cleaving to his mouth with that peculiarly
exhaustive thirst which is the effect of weariness and terror combined;
and when all three men blew their matches, and shook fresh
priming into the pans of their guns, the Lalla shut his eyes and expected
death.</p>

<p>"Come, Lallajee," said Gopal Singh, in a cheery voice, "don't go
to sleep, good man, we are near home now; no more 'coss burs,' you
know. Ah, by-and-by, you will know what a Canarese coss is.
Mind the horse as we go downhill," he continued to Lukshmun.
"I must have that beast; he has done his work right well to-day."</p>

<p>Almost as the last word was spoken, they reached the brow of
the ascent, and looked down upon Itga from the place we have
already described. It appeared gloomy enough to the Lalla. The
castle, or ghurry, stood out, a black mass, against the setting moon,
and the men and horses were barely distinguishable in the faint
light, while the towers at the gate, and round the outer walls,
seemed to be exaggerated in height and dimensions. From the window
over the castle gateway, a light twinkled brightly in the dark
mass of the walls, and there was one also on a bastion of the gate,
and a few here and there in the village. Around the fields and
trees were in the deepest gloom, the upper portion of the trees, where
the moon's rays caught the topmost branches only, being visible,
and a sparkle here and there in the little river, as it brawled over
the rocks and stones in its bed, its hoarse murmur being distinctly
audible as though it were in flood.</p>

<p>"Cheer up, Lallajee! be comforted; our master never keeps
any one in suspense very long," remarked Lukshmun pleasantly.
"When he says ch-ck, ch-ck, as I do to Motee here, we know exactly
what to do."</p>

<p>"Be quiet, for a prating fool, as thou art!" cried Gopal Singh,
"and look after the horse. I would not have his knees broken for a
thousand rupees. Sit square, O Lalla! lean back, good man, and
ease him as you go down. Do not be afraid."</p>

<p>But for this assurance the Lalla had fainted. "Ah, Jemadar,"
he exclaimed, "by your mother, I am too poor to notice&mdash;a stranger
in a strange land. I trust to you&mdash;pity me and be merciful, for the
sake of my children."</p>

<p>"Bichara! poor fellow, he has children&mdash;so have I," interrupted
Lukshmun; "and that makes it worse sometimes."</p>

<p>"Be silent, as you love your life," said the Jemadar, firing a shot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
over the Lalla's head, which caused him to start violently, and was
followed by another each from the two men in succession; "be
silent, and mind your seat downhill. If Maun Singh has not
arrived," he continued to the men, "there will have been trouble
enough by this time."</p>

<p>"They have passed not long ago, Jemadar," said Rama; "look,
here are the horses' footprints."</p>

<p>"That is good; and they see us now," continued Gopal Singh.</p>

<p>As he spoke, a vivid white flash, from the highest bastion turret
of the castle, increased in brightness, as a large Bengal light was
burned for an answering signal. The attitude of the signal-man, as
he held an iron cresset high above his head, could be distinctly
seen; and while the dazzling blaze continued, castle, and town, and
village&mdash;even the open ground beyond, and the trees and temple
upon it&mdash;were revealed in silvery brilliance. Then, as the first died
out, another light took its place, and burned out, leaving the gloom
more intense than before. Under any other circumstances, the
effect would have been as surprising to the Lalla as it was really
beautiful, but, under the circumstances, the sudden apparition of
the castle, with its defences and outworks, struck an additional
chill to his heart, and as the last gleam of the bright light went out,
it seemed a type of the extinguishing of his own hopes.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.</a></h2>


<p>Pahar Singh had been long watching from the window we have
before mentioned. There were three descents from the plain above
to the village, all within his view; and there were men on each of
the bastions also, watching in all directions. He was very restless
and moody; not even the gold found in several bags which he had
taken to his private apartments&mdash;not even the large amount of
booty, which had so few light coins in it&mdash;could dispel the gloom.
He had ordered all about him to be silent, and even Amrut Rao
had obeyed him as yet; and his little daughter, who was allowed
to sit in the hall when no strangers were present, had nestled to his
side, but was afraid to speak.</p>

<p>Ararat Rao knew, however, by experience, that the more his
master was allowed to brood over anything in this manner, the
harder it was to rally him; and as the account of the money had
been made up, he took the paper, trimmed the lamp, and stood in
an attitude to read, unchecked by the actual distortion of the
chief's face in a repressed fury, at which even his daughter concealed
herself, and cowered into a corner, and which soon broke
out in violent oaths and abuse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>Amrut Rao bent to the storm, and did not reply. After an
interval he read slowly:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Twenty-seven thousand two hundred and ninety-three rupees;
and the five bags of ashruffees which you took inside&mdash;how many
were in them?"</p>

<p>"What is that to you? do you want to steal them? By the
gods! you are over-familiar to-night, Amrut Rao. Did I not bid
ye all be silent, and dare you disobey? you&mdash;dare you?" cried
the chief, raising himself, while the foam gathered upon his lips,
and the veins swelled on his forehead. "Dare you?"</p>

<p>"My lord," replied Amrut Rao, joining his hands, "abuse of a
Brahmun, out of a noble mouth, is sin&mdash;unfitting to hear. Be
reasonable. This is the best booty which we have seen for many
a day. If we knew the total of the ashruffees we could add it,
and you could sign the day-book, and clear away all the bags. It
is getting late."</p>

<p>"Let it be. No, I will not sign the paper," cried Pahar Singh,
petulantly. "What need have I with wealth? he will not come
now. I will go to Kasee, Jugunath, and Raméshwur; I will give
up the world; I have committed much sin, and will have no more
of it. I will&mdash;&mdash; Ha, by the gods! there is a shot on the road,"
he continued, as the sharp ring of Gopal Singh's matchlock broke
the silence without: "another, and another! and a horse's neigh,
too; and there were but the three. Can it be they, Maun Singh?
speak! by your soul, speak: why are you silent?"</p>

<p>"Let the cloud pass from your spirit, brother: it is they, sure
enough. I would swear to Gopal's gun by its ring anywhere."</p>

<p>"Burn a light from the upper bastion&mdash;two! it may cheer them
down the pass. Quick!" cried the chief; "answer their signal.
O Maun Singh! if I said anything bad, forgive me, brother; but
I was distraught with care for that boy. Yes, they will see that,"
as the first blue light glittered over the village. "Burn another,
Ranoba&mdash;a large one!" he called from the window to the men
above; "we may even see them. By the gods! yes, Maun Singh,
there they are: the three, and a man on horseback muffled up&mdash;a
large grey horse&mdash;who can it be? Get hot water ready, and enough
for all to eat. Bring a goat to kill before him. Tell thy mother,
O daughter, to see to this; tell her they are come. How many short
rupees were there, Amrut Rao?"</p>

<p>"My lord, it was as I said: the Brahmuns' bellies would be
empty if we trusted to short rupees; all we could find were nine
doubtful ones."</p>

<p>"Then, count out fifty more&mdash;stay, a hundred: will that feed
them?"</p>

<p>"You have not told me how much gold there was, Maharaj,"
continued the Karkoon pertinaciously, not noticing the gift.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now, a plague on thee for an obstinate fool, Amrut Rao," replied
the chief, laughing; "did I not tell thee not to speak about
it?"</p>

<p>"The total of the silver is twenty-seven thousand two hundred
and ninety-three rupees," returned the Karkoon; "and the gold
must be added to complete the account before we retire."</p>

<p>"Well, then, there were five bags, and fifty Akburi mohurs in
each: will that content you? or must you see them?"</p>

<p>"Why couldn't you tell me this at first?" continued Amrut Rao,
writing in the account, which he spread on his left hand; "there,
at twenty rupees each, another five thousand, that makes thirty-two
thousand two hundred and ninety-three rupees. My lord ordered
fifty rupees for the dole to-morrow; it might as well be the odd
ninety-three."</p>

<p>"Ay, take that, and the two hundred over to boot, good fellow,
if thou wilt. Here, some of you, stop him, stop my son, and kill
a goat before him at the gate; see that lights are waved over him,
and the evil eye is taken off him. Quick! there are the torches
flashing in the bazar."</p>

<p>"I have deducted the sum, Maharaj," said the Karkoon deliberately;
"now look at the total, and put your seal to it. Thirty-two
thou&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"By Krishna! thou wouldst leave me no peace, Amrut Rao,"
replied the chief; "here is the seal; seal the memorandum, and
begone. Yet stay; thou art a good fellow after all; so take a
handsome doopatta, or a pair of dhotees, out of that coin for thyself."</p>

<p>"Not out of the Brahmuns' bellies," retorted the Karkoon;
"thank you. I shall have plenty of gifts by-and-by. Here is your
seal."</p>

<p>The chief might have answered angrily, had his attention not
been diverted at the moment. "Ah, here they are," he cried,
looking from the window; "they have brought the man's horse up
to the steps, and are taking him off&mdash;bound, too! Ai Purméshwar!
but there must be much to hear. Why do they delay?"</p>

<p>In truth they had not delayed; for several torch-bearers, stationed
at the gate, hearing the shots on the hill, had run forward in the
direction of the pass, while the retainers and others from the
bazar, crowded up to bid the young man welcome; for the anxiety
in the castle had spread over the village. So Gopal Singh and
his party entered the gates among many eager faces, lighted up
by torches tossing above them, and were welcomed by noisy shouts
as the men clustered round them. Then a bevy of village women
awaited them, some bearing brass dishes filled with mustard-seed,
and small lighted lamps, which were waved over him; others with
jars of water, which were poured out before him; and, as others<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
joined them, there was quite a procession up to the end of the
second traverse.</p>

<p>Farther on, at the gate of the castle, stood a body of the household
servants and retainers, one having a naked sword, and a goat
before him bleating loudly. As Gopal Singh advanced, the sword
flashed in the air, and the headless carcase struggled convulsively
as the blood spouted over the sill and step, and trickled down
towards the Lalla, who, lifted from his horse, shuddered as he was
set down among it.</p>

<p>Again the ceremony of having lights waved over him by some of
the women-servants was repeated; and Gopal Singh, bidding
Lukshmun and the others search the Lalla carefully and keep what
was found, ascended to the court, and was met in a warm embrace
by his uncle, and led to the window, where, being seated, all present,
including Maun Singh, advanced to salute him in turn.</p>

<p>"What did I say, brother?" cried Maun Singh joyfully. "I
knew he would not disappoint us. Yet thou shouldst not have gone
alone, Gopal."</p>

<p>"Nay, but I had the hunchbacks with me, and more would have
spoiled my small hunt, which, if not so grand as thine, uncle, may
yet be important," replied the young man.</p>

<p>"Ah, the boy, the boy!" exclaimed the chief, stroking the young
man's face, and kissing the tips of his own fingers; "have I not
brought him up since he was the height of my knee? And I
thought him lost&mdash;Ai Bhugwân, Bhugwân! Ai Purméshwar! He
is safe and well&mdash;safe and well, O Sri Máta! My heart swells.
What did I say for the Brahmuns? Never mind now. Go, bathe
and eat, my son, and we will see to everything afterwards."</p>

<p>"Not before that matter is settled, father&mdash;that is, about the man
I brought with me."</p>

<p>"Yes, I had forgotten&mdash;certainly. Light the large lamps," cried
the chief to the attendants at the lower end of the room; "let us
see what manner of man he is. Who is he, Gopal?"</p>

<p>"That we have to find out, father. They thought him a spy of
the Emperor's, and he came from Aurungabad, by Bheer, to Kullianee,
to the Gosai's. He changed some bills for gold, and he has
got it. I offered escort, but was refused; so I went from Muntalla
to the Burr tree at Kinny, for we heard he was going to sleep in the
Mutt at Surroori. They were sending him on privately, father."</p>

<p>"Shabash! well done, son. A spy? Well, if we are true to the
King's salt, he goes no farther; and he was being sent privately!
Ah, the old foxes! Here he is&mdash;what a sight!" cried the chief,
breaking into uncontrollable laughter. "Who art thou? What
have they done to thee? Speak."</p>

<p>In truth the poor Lalla was a show. The order to search him had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
been literally complied with, and while two stout fellows held his
arms wide apart, he was helpless to struggle. Rama and Lukshmun,
who would allow no one to touch him, had dived into every
pocket, and felt every possible place of concealment, even to the
Lalla's hair, which was loosened and hung about his shoulders. His
turban had been removed and shaken out, while one end was now
fastened to his right arm. The bag of gold, tied round his waist,
his bundle of precious papers, his sword, dagger, and waist-shawl,
had all been taken from him and made into a bundle, and the articles
were deliberately counted by the hunchback as they were deposited,
one by one, in the centre of the shawl spread out for the purpose.
It was quite in vain that the Lalla entreated, besought, struggled, or
resisted by turns; the place, the rough men around him, all forbade
hope of pity, and he submitted. Finally, Lukshmun dragging him
by the end of his turban, Rama pushing him behind, and several of
the others assisting, the Lalla was brought into the presence of the
chief, where he sank down, stupidly staring about him.</p>

<p>Where were all the fine speeches he had contrived, which should
have carried the chief's heart at once? All the couplets, too, from
the Bôstan that he was to have quoted?&mdash;All gone. His head was
bare, his clothes untied and hanging loosely about him; his boots
removed: and his appearance of utter helplessness, and the hopeless,
piteous expression of despair in his face, might have excited
compassion in any but the hardened men by whom he was surrounded
and confronted.</p>

<p>"Who art thou, knave? Speak," cried the chief, sternly, again
raising his voice and checking his laughter. "Who art thou?"</p>

<p>"There now, make a salaam to the 'Lion of the Jungle'" (as the
chief was called among his people), said Lukshmun, raising the
right hand of the Lalla to his head, which dropped helplessly.
"Ah, I see he is ashamed, poor man, of his naked head. There,
Lallajee," and he wound the turban round his head hastily, giving
it a ludicrous cock to one side, increasing, if possible, the grotesque
expression of the features&mdash;"there now, get up and make your Tusleemât,
else my lord may be angry; and he is not exactly safe when
he is," he added in a whisper. "Get up, and don't be afraid."</p>

<p>But the Lalla's terror was too great, his mouth too dry to speak.
"Am&#257;n, am&#257;n!&mdash;Mercy, mercy!" was all he could gasp.</p>

<p>"Who art thou, knave?" cried Pahar Singh again. "Whence
art thou come? Give a good account of thyself. Let go of him,
rascals!" he continued to the men who held him; "begone all of
ye."</p>

<p>"Maharaj," cried Lukshmun beseechingly to the chief, "here are
the Lalla's things; who will take them? Look, Rao Sahib," he
continued, to Amrut Rao, "here they are: count them. I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
done with them&mdash;for the Lion is getting savage&mdash;let me go. Beware,
O Lalla! take my advice, and tell all about yourself, else I
shall have to kill you somehow. You don't know the Maharaj as
I do."</p>

<p>This advice, and the diversion effected by the hunchback, afforded
the Lalla a little time for the recovery of his senses; but who could
have recognized the bland, accomplished Toolsee Das, in the abject
figure before them? Hastily pressing the turban straight upon his
brows, the Lalla arose, and, as well as he could, made the ordinary
Tusleemât.</p>

<p>"Shabash!" cried the chief. "Well done, that was never
learned in the jungle. Now speak truly, and at once, who art
thou?"</p>

<p>"Noble sir," returned the Lalla, "I claim your protection.
There has been a mistake about my treatment. My property has
been taken, and I have been misused&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I misuse thee, knave?" cried Pahar Singh, his brow darkening;
"who art thou to bandy words with Pahar Singh? I have never
seen thee before."</p>

<p>"Beware, Lallajee," said Gopal Singh; "did I not warn thee?
Say who thou art at once, or I will not answer for thee. Do not
eat dirt."</p>

<p>"Peace, boy!" interrupted the chief angrily; "the fellow looks
like a knave&mdash;a thief&mdash;his is no honest face. Speak; or, by the
gods, there will be scant ceremony with thee!"</p>

<p>"My lord, my lord!" cried the Lalla piteously; "mercy, I am no
thief; I am a poor Khayet of Delhi, travelling to Beejapoor, on
business of my own&mdash;a stranger&mdash;a poor stranger."</p>

<p>"What business, Lalla?"</p>

<p>"My lord, we are merchants, and have dealings with people there
for clothes and jewels. There is a dispute about the accounts, and
I have come to settle them," said the Lalla glibly enough. It was
one of the stories he had made up by the way.</p>

<p>"Who are the merchants?" asked the chief.</p>

<p>"The Gosais of the Mutt at Kullianee, where I was yesterday;
they sent me on," replied the Lalla.</p>

<p>"O, hear!" cried Gopal Singh; "they knew nothing about thee,
except that thou hadst a bill on them for a thousand rupees, and
the money was given thee in gold. Is not this true? Did I not hear
it myself?"</p>

<p>"Thou art no merchant, dog," exclaimed Pahar Singh. "Did
ever merchant make an obeisance like that? Ah, we are true testers
of gold here; the true and the false are soon found out. Who art
thou? speak truly, and fear not."</p>

<p>"By the shrine at Muttra, by the Holy Mother, I am what I say,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
a poor Khayet, a Mutsuddee only. O noble sirs," continued the
Lalla, "give me my property, and let me go. I will seek shelter in
the bazar: let me go, for the love of your children."</p>

<p>"I beg to petition," interposed Lukshmun, joining his hands,
"that, as I brought him, my share of the gold be given me before
he goes. I took care of him on the road&mdash;did I not, master?"</p>

<p>"Silence!" roared the chief; "any one who speaks shall be
flogged. Who art thou, O liar? Mutsuddee thou art, but whose?
Thy speech betrays thee&mdash;beware!"</p>

<p>"I have told you, noble sir. Thakoor Das, Preym Das is the
name of the firm; my name is Toolsee Das&mdash;Lalla Toolsee Das, your
slave to command. Ask at Kullianee, and the house will be known
there. I&mdash;I&mdash;am a poor man&mdash;a stranger; who knows me?" said
the Lalla, now whimpering.</p>

<p>"A fool, a liar art thou, throwing away life," returned Gopal
Singh. "This is the second time I have warned thee. We know
thou art from the royal camp, and a spy to Beejapoor. Speak,
else&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And the doom of a spy is death; and thou art a liar too, and a
coward to boot. Look at him now, Gopala," said his uncle, interrupting
and pointing to the man; "look at his coward face."</p>

<p>The Lalla was trembling violently. His knees shook, and his
teeth chattered audibly as he shivered. He could not speak, but
looked vacantly from one to another. "I am c-o-o-ld&mdash;c-o-o-o-ld,"
he said faintly; "the wet, sirs, and the long travel. Am&#257;n, am&#257;n!
I am only a merchant, let me go."</p>

<p>"Thou art cold! then we will warm thee," cried the chief grimly.
"Yet, speak, O Lalla, ere I give the order. We would not hurt thee
without cause&mdash;otherwise&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ai Narayun! Ai Rámchunder! believe me, I am no spy. I
swear by God I am no spy," he replied earnestly.</p>

<p>"Bind him!" cried the chief furiously. "A liar and a spy.
Make torches of his fingers! we will soon hear the truth."</p>

<p>Ere he knew what to do or say, the Lalla was a second time bound
with his own shawl; and Lukshmun, tearing a rag into strips, and
soaking them in the oil of the lamp, was tying them coolly upon the
ends of his fingers, one by one. "I told you, Lallajee," he said,
"we are rough people here, and you should be careful. When I
light these you will not like the pain, and if you bear that, he will
do something worse. When he says 'ch-ck, ch-ck,' you know&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>"Silence, knave! thou art over-familiar," cried Maun Singh;
"beware!"</p>

<p>"Nay, but if I can save him from the torches, uncle," returned
the hunchback, with a grotesque grin, "he will perhaps be grateful,
and give his wealth to me."</p>

<p>"Is it ready?" asked the chief.</p>

<p>"Quite ready, my lord," answered Lukshmun, taking one of the
lighted wicks from the large lamp between his finger and thumb,
"For your life, speak, good fellow," he said earnestly and under
his breath to the Lalla, "and save yourself this torture. One word
more from him, and I dare not disobey; few bear it&mdash;speak!"</p>

<p>"O, my lord! my lord!" shrieked the Lalla, now comprehending
what was intended, and throwing himself prostrate on the ground,
"do not burn me alive. I will speak the truth. Why should I tell
lies?"</p>

<p>"Very well," returned the chief, on whose lips the ominous foam
speckles were now visible. "Very well, get up; it is thine own
business. Thou hast not heard of our Dekhan customs, perhaps,
else I had not wasted words on thee. Speak, who sent thee?
Alumgeer? He cannot help thee now."</p>

<p>"He would have no mercy on me if he knew&mdash;if he had me in
his power," murmured the Lalla. "Loose me, my lord, I am faint,
and cannot speak; yet I will speak the truth. And should all
these hear? My lord knows best. Loose me, and have these rags
taken from my fingers."</p>

<p>"When thou hast told the truth, Lalla; not till then," said Pahar
Singh, slowly. "Dost thou hear? Away, all of ye!" he cried to
the attendants, who had crowded round the Lalla. "Keep the
torch alight. Now, Lalla," he continued, as the man stood alone
below the dais, "speak. Once more, and this is my last warning;
if I hear any more lies I will end that coward life of thine."</p>

<p>"Beware!" added Gopal Singh, "I would not be as thou art with
that lying tongue of thine&mdash;ugh! no, not for lakhs. Remember
that he, my uncle, never relents."</p>

<p>"I would rather speak to ye alone," said the Lalla.</p>

<p>"We three are as one. Yet stay," added the chief. "Go thou,
Amrut Rao, let him have his own chance for life&mdash;but remain
without."</p>

<p>"Do any of ye know the seal of the Wuzeer of Beejapoor," said
the Lalla, when they were alone, "or do ye know the writing of
Sivaji, the Mahratta Rajah?" He spoke with great difficulty, for
his mouth was parched and clammy, and his lips white.</p>

<p>"Nay, but Sivaji cannot write, Lalla. This is some fool's story.
Beware, too, how thou takest the name of my lord the Wuzeer,"
said the chief sternly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>"My lord, my lord, with death before me and one chance for life,
I cannot lie," returned the Lalla, sadly shaking his head. "My
hands are tied; but if one of you will open that bag, there will be
truth enough found in it to save me. There, Jemadar," he continued,
as Gopal Singh opened the bag, "in the side pocket are two
Persian letters, fastened up; look at them first; look at the seals.
If I am wrong I am wrong&mdash;I am helpless, do as ye like with me;
I am helpless."</p>

<p>"It is the Wuzeer's seal, his private seal, uncle," said Gopal
Singh excitedly. "Of this there is no doubt; look at it yourself."</p>

<p>"Ai Ram! Ai Seeta Ram! what have we here? It is the seal
truly," said Pahar Singh, looking at the impressions on both letters,
and rocking himself to and fro.</p>

<p>"Do any of ye read Persian?" asked the Lalla; "if so, read for
yourselves. I need not speak; they will speak for me."</p>

<p>"I will try, uncle," said Gopal Singh; "give me the letters. By
Krishna, father!" he continued, breaking the silence, and after his
eye had glanced over a few lines, "I would rather go into the
thickest fight than read treachery like this. Narayun, keep us!"</p>

<p>"Ay, may the gods be merciful, Gopala! But what is it?&mdash;what
is it?" said the chief eagerly.</p>

<p>"He would sell our kingdom of Beejapoor to the Padshah of
Delhi, uncle&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"People said so&mdash;people said so," said Pahar Singh, interrupting;
"but I did not believe it. What more, my son?"</p>

<p>"Nay, the style is too courtly for me to make much of it, but
both the letters are to the same effect. Where didst thou get these
letters, Lalla?"</p>

<p>"Noble gentlemen, if ye are true to your King's salt," exclaimed
the Lalla, seeing that he had made an impression on his hearers,
"then I deserve naught but good at your hands. I am in the royal
service; I saw the papers; I read what danger threatened Ali
Adil Shah; I took them; I escaped from the camp with them, to
carry them to him, and I am here. O, noble sirs, put me not to
loss and shame!"</p>

<p>On the next few words hung the Lalla's life. It were easy to kill
him and secure the papers. The Wuzeer had sent several urgent
messages to Pahar Singh lately. He had a matter of moment,
attended with great profit, to communicate. Was it about these
letters? The Wuzeer would give lakhs for them. The very
threat of disclosure to the King would extort any terms. Again, if
he denied them&mdash;and what more easy than to counterfeit his seal,
or use it upon forged papers? If he took this course, they would
be in a false position: false to the King and to the Wuzeer,&mdash;and
the King's threats had of late been very menacing. So, as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
deliberated, the Lalla's life hung in the balance, now ascending,
now descending, in the eager consultation which the three men
carried on in Canarese. The Lalla looked from one to another in
piteous supplication, not daring to speak, his mouth parched, and
trembling in every limb; for he felt this quick discussion, and the
increasingly savage glances of the chief towards him, to be for life
or for death.</p>

<p>"And this from Sivaji?" asked Gopal Singh, at length. "What
of it, Lalla?"</p>

<p>"It was with the others, and there are some more of older date
in the bag," he replied, "and of the Wuzeer's also. Sivaji's letters
had to be translated to the Emperor: I had to copy the translations,
and thus I came to know their contents. Noble sirs, I am telling
no lies; look at the seal. They said in the Dufter it was Sivaji
Bhóslay's. I do not know it myself."</p>

<p>"Keep the others close, and show this to Amrut Rao," said the
chief. "Here," he continued, as the Karkoon, being called, advanced,
"look at this; what dost thou make of it?"</p>

<p>The Karkoon looked at the seal and started. "May I open it?"
he said.</p>

<p>"Yes, read it to us," said the chief.</p>

<p>He read it over slowly twice.</p>

<p>"Well, what is it?" asked his master.</p>

<p>"What Moro Trimmul wrote from Tooljapoor&mdash;what they asked
you, my lord, to join in; and here is your name with five thousand
men in figures after it, and the Wuzeer's with a lakh."</p>

<p>"Is it genuine, think you? that is what we want to know," said
Gopal Singh.</p>

<p>"Certainly," replied the Karkoon; "there is the private mark
on the seal, and the signature 'Hé Venunti'&mdash;'this supplication'&mdash;is
all the Maharaj can write. No one could forge that, it is too
crooked. How did that man get it?"</p>

<p>"He stole it, Amrut Rao," said the chief; "and we are discussing
whether he ought to live or to die. What dost thou think?"</p>

<p>"As a traitor to the salt he has eaten, he ought to die, master,"
said the Karkoon, looking at the Lalla, who felt that his fate was in
the Brahmun's hands,&mdash;"but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That is just what I said! he is not fit to live," interrupted the
chief. "Let him die. Ho!"</p>

<p>"But"&mdash;continued the Karkoon in Canarese, persistently interrupting
the chief, and waving back Lukshmun, Rama, and others,
who were advancing&mdash;"if I may speak. He says he wants to take
them to Beejapoor. Let him have his own way. A bargain may
be made with Ali Adil Shah through his secretary the Meerza&mdash;not
by him" (and he pointed to the Lalla), "but by us. The letters will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
not alter the matter one jot, and my lord can act as he pleases
afterwards. We can send people with the Lalla."</p>

<p>"Excellently spoken, Amrut Rao; ye have all better brains than
I have. Then the papers are valuable?" said Pahar Singh.</p>

<p>"Yes, my lord, if properly vouched for; and the man who stole
them can give a better account of them than we can. The King
might give any money&mdash;a lakh of rupees&mdash;for them. He already
more than suspects the Wuzeer and Sivaji Bhóslay of being in league
with the Emperor, and would rejoice to get such proofs of their
treachery."</p>

<p>"Hark ye, Lalla," cried the chief, changing the language to
Oordoo, which he spoke well, "what didst thou expect to get for
these papers? What is the price of them?"</p>

<p>"My lord," he replied, simpering and putting up his joined hands,
"they may be worth lakhs&mdash;so the Gosais at Kullianee told me&mdash;anything
I liked to ask. They will negotiate the matter with the
secretary and the King for me; and if my lord would only condescend
to assist, I&mdash;I&mdash;would give&mdash;yes, he might be sure of a share."</p>

<p>"I of a share!&mdash;of a bribe! Art <i>thou</i> feeding me with a bribe?
O base dog, and son of a dog! Pig! I a share? O Lalla, thou art
surely mad, and fated to eat dirt. Enough of this! Ho, without!&mdash;Lukshmun!&mdash;hunchbacks!&mdash;away
with him; give him the handkerchief
in the outer court. Quick!" roared Pahar Singh, relapsing
into fury.</p>

<p>"Uncle! father! not now," cried Gopal Singh, entreatingly, and
touching his feet; then rising and stepping forward with joined
hands, "calm thyself. Not to-day, when I am safe; not to-day,
when I promised him life! Give his life to me for this day; after
that, as thou wilt."</p>

<p>"It is valuable, my lord," added Amrut Rao. "These papers
cannot tell their own story. Where could we say we got them?
He must go with them to authenticate them. Gopal Singh and I
can go to the city with him, and, after all, he deserves well of Ali Adil
Shah, though he has been a traitor to his own King. Give him to
us, my lord; we may get good out of him."</p>

<p>"No," said the chief, after a moment's pause, "no, Rao Sahib, I
will go myself. I will see the end of this matter. Thou shalt come
with me, Maun Singh; and we can work through thy brother,
Amrut Rao. A lakh, saidst thou, O Lalla? Well, I will give thee
a share if thou art true. And now I give thy life to thee&mdash;buksheesh!&mdash;a
free gift&mdash;a new life, O Lalla. See that thou make good use of
it, for what I give I can recall. Go: they will see to thy food and
comfort, and thou wilt eat in a Rajpoot's house of the race of the Sun."</p>

<p>The Lalla would have said something about his gold and his
horse; the words were in his mouth, and it was well, perhaps, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
could not speak. The revulsion was too great for him, from life to
apparently imminent death, and again from death to life. Weary
with travel and faint with hunger, he had sunk down insensible, and
they carried him away into the court.</p>

<p>"The King has been seeking my life, friends, for some time past,"
said the chief musingly. "Perhaps it would be well to use these
papers&mdash;that is&mdash;&mdash; Yes," he continued, "I have eaten his salt&mdash;I
and my father&mdash;and we eat it now. My heart revolts at this treachery,
and we can be faithful with many another. Let us rouse the boy.
There should be good stuff in Mahmood Adil Shah's son, and I will
try it. As for the Wuzeer, I know what he would have me do, but
I will not say it, else should we have been left quiet so long, and the
army so near us? Stay ye here, Gopal and Amrut Rao. If he send
for me, go to him at Nuldroog; 'tis but a ride. Go and take his
money, then come to me at the city. I shall be in the old place; and
bring the hunchbacks with you, there may be work for them."</p>

<p>The Lalla recovered as they carried him gently into the open air,
and bathed his face with water.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Lukshmun, who was the most active of his attendants,
and was unbinding the shawl, "see what care I take of thee,
O Lalla; better your fingers are sound than roasted; better your neck
straight than twisted; better have to eat good food here&mdash;it is so
good&mdash;than have thy mouth filled with mud and water in the river
yonder&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My gold, my gold!" gasped the Lalla, interrupting him, "who
has got it? at least get that for me."</p>

<p>"He has got it," replied the hunchback, pointing with his thumb
backwards. "Better he, than I or my brother; we should only
spend it&mdash;he won't. Thy star is bright to-night, Lallajee. When
thou art set free do not forget us, that's all. Come."</p>

<p>They conducted him to a small chamber within, where two decently-clad
women awaited them&mdash;slaves or servants&mdash;and informed
the Lalla that a bath had been prepared for him, and food would be
served to him in the eating-room.</p>

<p>We are assured, therefore, that the Lalla was left in good hands.
There was perhaps a shade too much garlic in the cookery, he
thought; but he was not particular, and appetite returned with
absence of fear. When he had finished, he was summoned to the
chief, and it was not without apprehension that he went; but he was
now received kindly, though with a rough sort of civility, and
motioned to sit near Gopal Singh. So assured, the Lalla's habitual
confidence soon returned, and he took his part, with much ability,
in the discussion that followed, in which his information in regard
to the Emperor's designs was most valuable.</p>

<p>How the consultation ended will hereafter appear in another
locality, to which we must now transport our readers.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII.</a></h2>


<p>The Azân, or evening call to prayers, had just ceased throughout
Beejapoor. From mosque to mosque, and minaret to minaret, the
sonorous and musical voices of the Muezzins had proclaimed the
evening invitation to worship. It was still light, though the vivid
hues of sunset were fading fast, and the warm red and orange tints,
which had rested upon the minarets, domes, and gilded pinnacles of
the palaces, mosques, and mausoleums of the superb city, were giving
place to a sober grey. Here and there a star already twinkled in the
heavens, and a few rosy clouds, on which the sun's rays rested
lingeringly, floated away eastwards before a gentle breeze, that
rustled among the tall palm trees. For a time the busy hum of the
populous city seemed to be hushed, and the stillness and seclusion of
the spot we have to describe, prompted those feelings of devotion
which the time required.</p>

<p>It was one of those small yet elegant mosques, which are found
scattered everywhere about the ruins that now exist, surrounded by
enclosures that were once gardens, in which broken fountains and
dry watercourses now only suggest visions of their former elegance
and comfort, and where low brushwood and tangled grass have displaced
the fragrant flowers and useful fruit trees of former days.
Here and there a jessamine, now wild, trails over ruined walls and
once trim garden terraces, or a long-lived hardy lime tree struggles
for existence in the unwatered soil.</p>

<p>At the period of our tale, however, the building was in its full
freshness and beauty. A single arch, of low Saracenic form, led into
a square room vaulted by delicate groins, leading from the corners
to the base of a cupola above. The floor was formed of chequers of
black and white marble, highly polished; and the sides of the room,
deeply indented by arched niches, were finished with stucco, which
rivalled the marble in polish and purity of colour. Around the
largest niche, at the end opposite to the entrance, and the arch in
which the pulpit stood, were borders of delicate arabesque foliage,
into which texts from the Kôrán, in coloured enamel letters, were skilfully
and elegantly interwoven; while above the pulpit itself, in gold
letters on a black ground, was the Arabic text, "La Alla, il Alla,
Mahomed russool Alla;" "There is no God but one God, and Mahomed
is the prophet of God." Two plain cotton carpets, striped
red and white, had been placed before the pulpit, to be used by those
who might come to the evening prayer.</p>

<p>Outside, the front of the mosque was composed of the dark-coloured
basalt used in all the buildings of the city, beautifully
finished as to the fitting of the stones, on which bold cornices and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
rosettes had been executed round the entrance arch, and about the
projecting portion which supported the small minarets. Immediately
above the archway, broad stone eaves crossed the face of the
building, resting upon deep and richly carved brackets of black basalt,
surmounted by a bold cornice, over which were fleurs-de-lis, forming
the upper ornament. Under the projecting eaves, and on the crest
of the entrance arch, were bright flowers in coloured enamel, bordered
by frames of delicate white stucco work, which relieved the
rich but monotonous tint of the stone, without disturbing the chaste
effect of the whole. In the centre of the terrace, before the mosque,
was a small fountain, for the purpose of ablution, which threw up a
tiny thread of water to some height in the air, descending in a shower
of light spray, and producing a faint, plashing sound, very grateful
to the ear.</p>

<p>Above the mosque, and mingling with its slender minarets and
thin gilded spires, a few cocoa-nut trees waved their graceful pendant
leaves; and with them the heavy foliage of the fragrant moulserry,
and the broad leaf of the plantain, with its tender yet vivid green,
formed an harmonious contrast. Nearer the terrace was a group of
orange trees, some weighed down by clusters of golden fruit, others
covered with blossom, which, with the tuberoses around the fountain,
and the evening jessamine now opening, gave forth to the cool evening
air a fragrance almost overpowering. By day, the sun hardly
ever reached the mosque, and it always appeared invitingly cool and
quiet; but at this evening hour, shadow was rapidly deepening into
gloom, adding a solemn effect which enhanced the beauty of this secluded
spot.</p>

<p>Two persons stood by the fountain. They had just performed their
ablutions, as the last quivering chant of the Muezzin, "La illa, il
Ulla," issuing from the tall minaret of one of the neighbouring
mosques, floated to them on the soft breeze: yet they appeared to
hesitate ere they entered the mosque for the evening prayer. One
of them was an elderly woman, clad as befitted the position of the
favourite nurse and confidential female servant of a wealthy house,
in a blue cotton petticoat of thick but fine texture, over which, and
around her body and head, was a white muslin scarf. Her features
were homely, yet good-natured, and she evidently regarded her companion,&mdash;who
merits a fuller description,&mdash;with pride mingled with
deep affection.</p>

<p>And, in truth, there were few fairer maidens in Beejapoor, even
among the wealthy and high-born nobles, than Zyna, the only
daughter of Afzool Khan. Her features might be called irregular,
according to any European standard, but they were soft and inexpressibly
charming; and in her large lustrous eyes, of the deepest
brown, there lurked a world of deep feeling which the excitement of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
life would call into action. About her rounded chin and small mouth,
whose full and bow-shaped lips had somewhat of a voluptuous expression,
there played a thousand charms, which, though they might
not disclose themselves or be observed while her features were at
rest, yet, as her first timid reserve gave place to the excitement of
conversation or passing incident, exercised a strange but irresistible
fascination over those about her.</p>

<p>She was very fair for her country. Her mother's bright Georgian
complexion was but little deepened in her daughter's richer and
browner cast of colour; the skin appeared to possess that transparent
softness which gave a bewitching charm to the delicate yet
decided features; and her cheeks and neck flushed, under any excitement,
with a warmth which told of her southern and more
excitable temperament. Whenever she spoke, the upper lip was
raised higher than usual, disclosing a rosy mouth, with teeth which
glistened like pearls, even and small; and from the absence of any
ornament in the nostril, it was evident that, as yet, no marriage rite
had been performed. Her age might be fourteen, or even less; but
her figure, from its rounded proportions and grace, would have induced
a presumption that she was older.</p>

<p>Yet it would have been only a passing thought. One look at that
innocent, almost childish face&mdash;where, though full of bright intelligence,
the world had as yet fixed no stamp of care to check the
natural joyousness of her spirit&mdash;would have dispelled it instantly;
and if the habitual brightness was sometimes dimmed, it was but as
the breath upon a mirror&mdash;the passing shadow of some gentle disappointment,
which enhanced the beauty as it passed away.</p>

<p>There was no mark of rank or wealth about her, except in the
solid gold anklets of heavy chainwork she wore, which fitted closely
over her high bare instep: a ring of gold hanging loosely about her
neck, and a rosary of large pearls usually worn there, but which were
now passing rapidly, and apparently mechanically, through her
fingers, as if the thoughts that urged them were somewhat agitated.
There was, too, a slight knitting of the brow while she idly, and perhaps
somewhat impatiently, dabbled with one naked foot in the
water which was welling over the rim of the fountain, sending circles
of small wavelets over its otherwise unruffled surface, as she looked
eagerly to the entrance-door of the garden as if in expectation of
some one. As she stood thus upon a step, her foot resting upon the
raised rim of the fountain&mdash;the vivid scarlet of her satin petticoat,
and the white of the fine muslin scarf which, wound about her
person, and passed over her head&mdash;were reflected in its trembling
waters; and, with the mosque and dark trees behind her, and the
figure of the old nurse sitting on the step at her feet, a picture was
formed such as no man could have looked on without emotion, and
admiration of a being so eminently lovely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>"You are my witness, Goolab," she said at length, looking down
on the nurse, "that he said he would come to evening prayer, and
that I have waited thus long. The time is passing fast, and you
know this is the second night he has disappointed me. O, that he
may not be careless to God's service! He used not to be so. But
I am not angry with him, nurse," she continued, looking down to
the attendant; and as she spoke, every trace of displeasure, if it had
ever existed, disappeared at once before her habitual good humour
and sweet smile; "he never disappointed me, that he had not some
very good reason for staying away&mdash;and yet&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nay, my soul," returned the woman, "the Azân is but just said,
and there is yet ample time for prayer; the carpets have not been
half spread in the Jumma Mosque yet. Why should you be impatient?
But listen, was I not right? My young lord comes, so
think him faithless no longer."</p>

<p>As she spoke the door of the garden court opened, and with a cry
of joy Zyna sprang to meet her brother, as with rapid steps he
traversed the garden, and ascended the low terrace before the
mosque.</p>

<p>Still of tender age, Fazil Khan was already a remarkable figure.
The down of youth had not yet hardened upon his lip and chin; but
his tall athletic frame, and erect and confident carriage, proved him
to have been engaged in the actions, if not the strife, of the world.
His animated features strongly resembled his sister's, but with a
sterner and bolder cast of expression, while his colour was much
darker. A large grey eye, with remarkably long lashes, which he
had from his mother, increased their grave, thoughtful, yet tender,
and perhaps almost mournful, expression; the same sweet smile as
Zyna's played about his mouth as he returned her joyous welcome,
while his glistening eye and excited manner proved that something
unusual had occurred, not only to delay him, but to cause an emotion
he could not well repress.</p>

<p>"Ah, thou art a sad truant, Fazil," said Zyna, as, after their first
greeting, he laid aside his sword and shield, loosened his waist-band,
and prepared to perform his ablutions; "armed, too, more heavily
than usual, while thy face tells me thou hast met with some recent
adventure. Thou hast not been in danger.... Fazil, my brother!"</p>

<p>"Danger!" echoed the youth; "if to walk the streets of Beejapoor
amidst contending factions, where one can hardly tell a friend
from an enemy, be danger, why then, dear sister, I have had my
share even now. But, trust me, there is no real danger to me. Come
then to prayer, for the Azân is said, and the light already fails us."</p>

<p>So saying, they ascended the mosque steps together. Their carpets
were already spread, and they at once engaged in the service of
the evening, well known to the youth, but in the performance of
which, his sister was as yet only his gentle and docile pupil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>It would seem that their appearance, as they descended the steps
of the mosque together after the prayer was finished, and came out
again upon the terrace by the fountain, had more than ordinarily attracted
the nurse's attention, for she advanced, and passing her hands
rapidly over them from head to foot, pressed her knuckles against
her temples; and as they cracked loudly, ejaculated a fervent wish
for a thousand years' life and prosperity to each. Such acts are
common to the privileged native servants of India, and old Goolab
had been their faithful attendant since they were born, and had carefully
watched their growth. Both loved her warmly, and there was
nothing either would have grudged, to soothe the declining years of
their old favourite.</p>

<p>"Enough, enough, Goolab," cried Fazil, as, after several repetitions
of the ceremony we have just mentioned, she stroked his chin
with her fingers, and kissed their tips; "what evil do you think has
come to me that you take it on yourself?"</p>

<p>"Alas, I know not!" said the nurse, sighing; and as she spoke
her eyes filled with tears; "but my lord said there had been danger,
and I would not have it so. And what evil glances may not have
been cast on my beautiful child all through the streets to-day?"</p>

<p>The youth made a slight gesture of impatience, but it was lost on
the fond old woman. Checking the feeling which had prompted it,
he cried cheerfully, "No, no, Goolab, believe me, I meant no more
than ordinary danger; are we not always in it? And who can tell
the hour of his death?" he added after a pause, and looking reverently
upwards; "or whether it is to come by a bullet or a sword-cut,
long wasting fever or sudden sickness; nay, here as we stand!
When the message comes we cannot stay."</p>

<p>"Hush, say not so, brother," said Zyna, gently laying her hand
upon his mouth; "talk not so of death."</p>

<p>"Nay, my rose, he says but the truth," added Goolab; "and who
knew it better, than the pure saint your mother, who sleeps yonder?
Well, it was God's will, and who shall gainsay it? Meah is right,
my pet, but death should not be sent to the like of you; only to the
old servant who is ripe for the harvest&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We linger," said Fazil to his sister, interrupting her; "and the
darkness is fast spreading. I have much to do ere midnight, and I
must go to prepare for it. I will meet thee at the evening meal before
I start&mdash;&mdash;Yet once more to take leave of thee, O mother!"
he said to himself; "there may be danger to-night, and if it should
be&mdash;&mdash;Come, Zyna," he resumed, "a few flowers for the tomb, and
I must go. Get a light, Goolab&mdash;the lamp may as well be lighted
now."</p>

<p>"I had placed them before you came, Fazil; but come; again may
she look down on her children together," said his sister.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>So saying, she gathered a few jessamine and moulserry flowers
and, with her brother following, passed to the end of the garden
court, where, among some others, stood a high tomb of polished
black stone, with a pillar at the back in which was a niche for lamps
that were lighted every evening.</p>

<p>Reverently and tenderly were the fresh flowers laid at the head
and feet of the tomb by both. One could see no morbid motive in
the act, and there were no tears or vain regret. Their creed, imbued
as it is with fatalism, had taught them submission, and the offering
up of flowers every evening after the Azân, as the lamps were
lighted, had become a simple duty, never committed to others. If
those two loving and simple hearts believed that their mother's spirit
was thus rejoiced, it will account to us for that constant remembrance
of the dead which is so affecting, and generally so sincere, among the
Mahomedan families of India.</p>

<p>"Come," said Fazil, "we must not delay; though indeed, O sweet
mother! I could stay long with thee to-night," he added, touching
the foot of the grave gently, and raising his hand to his head. "I
kiss thy feet, O mother! may thy blessing rest upon me. Be not
far from us, O beloved! Come, Goolab, give me the lamp, and I will
place it myself to-night."</p>

<p>"What ails the boy?" said the nurse to herself, as Fazil advanced
with the lamp, lighted the others, and placed it in the niche with the
customary prayer. "What ails him to-night? Truly there is danger,
and he has done all those things himself that he may meet her&mdash;&mdash;If
it be the will of Alla, who can gainsay it? but not so, O Protector!"
she muttered; "not so. I vow Fatehas at the mosque next Friday if
he is spared," she said inwardly, weeping.</p>

<p>Fazil's errand was done, and as he turned he saw the old nurse
wiping her eyes. "Ah, weeping, Goolab?" he said. "No, no, that
is of no use now."</p>

<p>"No, Meah, truly of no use," she replied; "but memory is often
too much for me when I think upon her. Yet I will not weep&mdash;of
what use would it be?"</p>

<p>"None, old nurse, none; come, get me my dinner, for I have much
to do ere midnight."</p>

<p>"Will our father join us?" asked Zyna.</p>

<p>"I think not; I left him engaged with affairs of importance with
the King's secretary in the Durbar, and he did not speak of return.
I will wait a little for him, but should I not see him, thou must tell
him, Zyna, that I am gone on the King's business. But hurry the
dinner; I go only to give a few orders, and I will be with thee
presently."</p>

<p>So saying he left them, and quitted the garden by another door
which led to the outer court, where the guard-houses allotted to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
retainers of his father's house were situated. Goolab followed to
bar the door after him, which was kept closed on the inside, and,
returning to Zyna, said, "Did he tell thee what he was going to do,
my life?"</p>

<p>"No," said Zyna sadly; "he would not tell me, nurse, and I dared
not ask him. He said he would explain all by-and-by, and he will.
I know he will," she added, clapping her hands; "he always trusts
me."</p>

<p>"I only hope he is in none of these plots that they say are going
on," returned the nurse.</p>

<p>"What plots, Goolab?" asked Zyna with apprehension.</p>

<p>"O, I know not," replied the old woman, with a puzzled air, and
passing her hand across her eyes; "only people in the bazar say so;
and the Bangle woman, after she had put on your new set the other
day, said something about the Mahrattas and Sivaji Bhóslay."</p>

<p>"O, the Kafirs!" cried Zyna, laughing; "I have no fear for them,
if that is all. I was afraid of worse. But come, or we shall keep
him waiting."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII.</a></h2>


<p>Entering another small court, in which there was a stone porch
formed of pillars connected by arches, supporting a dome in the shape
of half an octagon, projecting from a side-wall, which served as a
private place of audience&mdash;Fazil passed through a farther door into
one of the large exterior courts of the mansion, which contained an
open hall composed of a triple row of pointed arches covering a large
space. Generally, it was filled with the better classes of horse-soldiers;
Silladars, or cavaliers who rode their own horses and sat
there when not on duty; also by the officers and men of the young
Khan's own guard: and occasionally was used by his father when
were held great ceremonies, festivals, or rejoicings in the house.</p>

<p>On the three other sides of the court were arches or cloisters,
slightly raised from the ground, in which lounged or slept soldiers of
all classes, on duty or otherwise, generally collected into groups,
playing at chess, or pacheese, or cards, singing, or telling stories.
Just then, however, most were idle; for the lamps, which stood in
niches in the centre of each arch, had not been lighted. The large
hall was nearly empty; but in one corner a group of Karkoons, or
clerks, sat with a large brass lamp in the midst of them, occupied
with accounts, and making fair copies of letters to be despatched
by that night's post.</p>

<p>All the men assembled here were strictly the retainers of the house;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
for the guard of troops belonging to the King had another post in a
different court, and were comparatively few in number. Afzool
Khan's household force, or Päègah, as it was called, was supported
out of royal estates, granted or assigned for the purpose. It belonged
strictly to the royal service, but the men looked to their own lord for
employment and maintenance, followed him to the field, and were
for the most part hereditary retainers, with no claim upon, or expectation
from, royal favour. Such was the condition and constitution
of the greater portion of native armies at the period of our tale, and
such it continues to be in native states where troops are maintained.</p>

<p>Fazil Khan was the idol of his men, both Moslems and Hindus.
His martial exercises had begun early, and he had proved an apt
scholar. Any of the men who particularly excelled in the use of a
particular weapon had, in turn, the young noble for his pupil; and
in all field accomplishments necessary to the soldier and gentleman
of those days, the young Khan was well skilled. No doubt these,
and his daily systematic exercises, had developed a frame always
strongly knit; and his broad deep chest, round muscular arms, and
thin flanks, amply testified strength and activity.</p>

<p>On horseback with the Mahratta spear or matchlock, it was no
hyperbole to say that, at full gallop, he could pick up a tent-peg
driven into the ground with the former, or shatter one at a fair distance
with a bullet from the other. Such martial accomplishments
never fail to gain the respect and attachment of an inferior soldiery;
and when to these were added a disposition open and cheerful, somewhat
hasty perhaps at times, but in reality generous and affectionate,&mdash;a
hearty frank manner, which few could resist, and a countenance,
not strictly handsome, but which expressed all this and even more,&mdash;it
will not be thought strange, that the young Khan should have become
a universal favourite with his retainers, and the especial
darling and idol of a few.</p>

<p>Chief, perhaps, among the latter, was Bulwunt Rao Bhóslay, who
held rank in the Päègah as Duffadar, or leader of a small "duffa," or
subdivision of men. He was a Mahratta of good, nay, originally
noble family&mdash;a Silladar, or cavalier who maintained not only his own
horse but five others, with which, mounted by dependants of his own,
he had originally visited the capital and joined the service of Afzool
Khan.</p>

<p>Him, had the young Khan selected as his especial instructor in the
use of the sword; for at the annual festivals and games before the
King's palace, Bulwunt Rao's feats of slicing betel-nut on the ground,
cutting a lime in two on the palm of a man's hand, or a ripe guava
on his head, were unrivalled; and their yearly repetition was looked
for by the people with great interest, and always rewarded by hearty
acclamations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>Bulwunt Rao was worthy of his young lord's confidence. Daring
and resolute, he had already led Fazil Khan into the midst of some
sharp cavalry affairs with the Moghuls, and brought him forth safe,
while he himself had been wounded several times in protecting him
from sword-cuts. Wily, yet full of energy, if there were any necessity
for action, open and frank in his manner, he had early won his
young lord's affectionate regard, which he very heartily returned,
while he rejoiced, with all a soldier's pride, to see him growing up as
manly and true of heart as his boyhood had promised.</p>

<p>Fazil's arrival among those assembled&mdash;so suddenly, and at an
hour when he usually withdrew to the zenana and his studies&mdash;caused
no little excitement among the men, and they eagerly crowded
round him for the news which he might have to tell them.</p>

<p>"What tidings hast thou for us, Meah Sahib?" cried a fine
bearded fellow of his own tribe of Pathans, also a favourite. "May
thy prestige increase! but there should be something by thy look,&mdash;a
march against those zenana dogs of Moghuls, or a fray over the
border against Golconda."</p>

<p>"A hunt of Moghuls!" echoed several. "What better sport,
Meah? There are some pickings of Delhi gold to be got in their
waist-bands and pockets."</p>

<p>"And what has my lord for his servants to perform?" asked
Bulwunt Rao, now advancing with his usual easy yet deferential
manner. "Speak but the word, and we are in our saddles directly.
Shall I order the Nagara to be beaten, and cry to horse!"</p>

<p>"Not so, Bulwunt," said the young man, taking him aside; "what
I have to say is for your ear alone. Come into the private court and
listen."</p>

<p>"For me alone, Meah?" returned Bulwunt Rao, laughing.
"What brawl have you fallen into? whom have you slain to-day,
sir?"</p>

<p>"Let us all follow if ye are going out," cried several others;
"don't leave us behind."</p>

<p>"We have had nothing to do for a month," added one.</p>

<p>"And our swords have lost their edges, Meah," shouted several.</p>

<p>"Peace, all of ye," exclaimed the young Khan; "let no one follow
us. This is no fighting matter. Am I wont to plunge into street
brawls, Bulwunt Rao?"</p>

<p>"We were none of us with you, my lord, to-day," cried several,
"and it is not safe for you to be alone in the streets in these times."</p>

<p>"I had others of the King's, and was quite safe," returned Fazil;
"but come, Bulwunt, if you are fit to listen to me; I only fear that
ganja pipe of yours is at fault, and your brain is hardly clear. If
not, I had as well hold my tongue; yet I had rather trust you, old
friend," he continued seriously, "than any other."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>Fazil's altered tone and manner had their effect upon his companion.
"Wait for a moment, Meah," he said, "I will join you
instantly;" and so saying, he ran quickly back to the spot where he
had left his carpet, seized a brass vessel of cool water, poured some
into his hand and dashed it upon his face, then swallowed several
rapid and deep gulps, and returned. "Now, I am fit to listen to the
words of the holy Krishna himself if he were on earth; therefore
speak on, Meah Sahib, and behold your servant ready to think for
you, or to fight for you, as you please!"</p>

<p>"Ay, there is some soberness about you now, Bulwunt," said the
young man; "less redness about the eyes, and they are looking
straight out of your head, instead of rolling about in it. Now, can
I trust you not to prate of this matter before the people yonder, or over
the ganja pipe&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nay, Meah, be merciful, and pardon me for once," said Bulwunt,
closing his hands and putting them up to his forehead; "the ganja
has grown on me, but not to the discredit of my faithfulness, Meah;
and when I smoke I never talk. Now, say on, I will be silent as
death."</p>

<p>Fazil proceeded some paces through the court without replying to
his retainer, and tried the garden door, but it was fastened inside.
"We must be content here," he said. "Go, shut the door, we shall
at least be safe from interruption."</p>

<p>"In the name of all the gods, Meah," said Bulwunt Rao, as he returned
and sat down on the step of the porch beside Fazil, "what
hast thou to say to me? Why all this need of caution? Has the
Wuzeer revolted, or what?"</p>

<p>"Silence," returned Fazil, "hear me. In one word, you are a
Mahratta&mdash;is Tannajee Maloosray known to you?"</p>

<p>The question seemed for an instant to stun the faculties of the
hearer. He passed his hand dreamily across his forehead and eyes,
and, pausing, seemed to gasp. Fazil thought it might be a sudden
dizziness&mdash;the consequence of the strong narcotic he had been
smoking&mdash;and was about to ask him, when Bulwunt Rao spoke.</p>

<p>"Tannajee Maloosray! Meah? Do I know Maloosray? Ay,
truly, Khan; as the wild dog and the wolf, as the wild boar and the
tiger know each other, so do I know Tannajee Maloosray. The destroyer
of my house, the usurper of my possessions, the plunderer
of my ancestral wealth. Yes, there is a feud between us which can
be washed out only by blood. Listen, Meah," continued Bulwunt
Rao, and he got up and walked rapidly to and fro: "hast thou time
to hear a short story about Tannajee?"</p>

<p>"Yes, speak on. I am listening."</p>

<p>"I was a youth," continued Bulwunt, "younger than you are by
several years, when Maloosray aimed his blow at my family. My<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
father was dead; had he lived, Tannajee dared not have done it.
My uncle, Govind Rao, was a timid man, looking only to the farms
and to money-making while he lived. At last he died also. But he
left another brother, Ramdeo, whom we loved much, and he took care
of us all. My younger brother, Seeta Ram&mdash;why speak of him, Meah?
he would have been as beautiful as thou art&mdash;and some of the women
and myself, all lived together in the old house. They came at midnight,
Tannajee and a band of his Mawullees. I do not remember
much, Meah; but look here;" and he took off his turban and showed
a deep scar on his shaved head. "That is what I fell from, under a
blow of his sword. I don't think," he continued dreamily, "that I
have been quite right in my brain since, but it does not matter.</p>

<p>"Next morning there were seven stark corpses in the house, and
great pools of blood. My uncle, my grandmother, two servants&mdash;how
can I say it?&mdash;yes, my mother and my little brother, and my
mother's sister, who was a widow. One blow of a sword had killed
my brother and my mother. He was in her arms, and had clung to
her. Enough; who could have done this but Maloosray? There
is not a sword in all Maharástra which could have struck such a
blow as that was&mdash;but Maloosray's.</p>

<p>"When I recovered consciousness in the morning, the women that
remained, and some servants, were wailing over the dead, but they
were barely alive from terror. Neighbours however came in, and
some of our tenants and servants, and the place was cleaned up. In
the evening there were seven piles made near the river for the seven
corpses, and they were burned. My wound had been sewn up by
the barber, and I was carried to perform the last ceremonies, and I
then swore upon their ashes to revenge them, and I will yet do it.
Now, by thy father's salt, tell me what thou knowest of that villain
Maloosray, and how his name comes into thy mouth?"</p>

<p>"And was nothing done for justice, Bulwunt? Was justice dead
in that country?" asked Fazil, deeply interested.</p>

<p>"Justice!" echoed Bulwunt Rao, "justice! Ah, Meah, what can
the poor do for justice? All the wealth of the house had been plundered.
Maloosray had brought a hundred of his brethren in that Duróra,
and he had promised them the plunder. His object was my life, but
the gods spared it, and I came here to serve the King, till&mdash;till
Tannajee is dead, or till I kill him, Meah! That is the only justice I
want: that, and the land he took from me. I thought to tell thee
all some day, and now I have said it; but, by thy soul, tell me how
Maloosray's name is known to thee, and why?"</p>

<p>"Should you know him again, Bulwunt, if you saw him?" asked
Fazil.</p>

<p>"Know him, Meah&mdash;among a thousand&mdash;among a thousand. It
is years since we met; but, before that quarrel with my father about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
the land, he came to us often, for he was my mother's relative. He
hunted large game on our hills, when I went with him, and I was a
great favourite of his. Most of the sword-play I know, he taught
me. Know him? Yes. That night I, a stripling, crossed swords
with him. I had wounded one of his men, and he heard the cry.
He had been seeking for me. What could I do, Meah, a weak boy,
among a crowd of screaming women? Yet I crossed swords with
him; and there are few alive who would dare to do so. Forget him?
No, I should know him among a thousand. His eyes, Meah, his
eyes! Hast thou seen them?"</p>

<p>"Nay, I have not seen them yet, Bulwunt; but I think I know
where he is to be found," returned Fazil.</p>

<p>"Here, Meah? in Beejapoor? Tannajee Maloosray in the city?"</p>

<p>"Yes, here. You are always rambling about the city at night, and
know all the mudud khanas; canst thou guide me to one Rama's
shop&mdash;Rama of Ashtee? It is in the great kullal's bazar, and near
a Hindu temple."</p>

<p>"I know it, Meah; I know it well. Rama sells the best ganja in
Beejapoor. Yes, I can take you there, but not in those clothes."</p>

<p>"Not now. Let the night wear on a little; they will not be there
till just before midnight," replied Fazil; "and we have to watch the
temple, too. Is there one near Rama's, with trees about it? Some
people meet there first, and then go to Rama's."</p>

<p>"Yes, Meah, there is the temple of Dévi, in the plain beyond,
among the tamarind trees; a lonely place it is, and Byragees put up
there. Yes, I know it."</p>

<p>"Then I am right," continued Fazil, "for I saw it myself to-day.
Now, as Maloosray is desperate, should we not take some picked men
with us? There is Raheem Khan, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Men?&mdash;to take Maloosray?" cried Bulwunt. "O Meah, you
are simple to think it. Maloosray will have twenty, aye fifty, spies
out, and old Rama is chief of them. One soldier a coss off, and
Tannajee would be warned. But why go, Meah?" he continued,
after a pause. "I will take my own men and bring him. O,"
cried Bulwunt, speaking through his teeth and to himself, "for one
good chance and a fair field with him now!"</p>

<p>"No, Bulwunt, I must go; it is the King's business," returned
Fazil; "besides Persian may be spoken, and you do not understand it."</p>

<p>"Persian, my lord? then this is a Moghul affair?"</p>

<p>"I cannot say, friend," returned Fazil; "all I have discovered is,
that Maloosray will be in the temple, or in the mudud khana, and a
'Lalla.' There is no good, I am sure, at the bottom of it, and we
must find out what it is. We know the Moghul emissaries are busy,
and it is important to check their plots."</p>

<p>"And Sivaji Bhóslay's also, Meah, they bode no good; for my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
people write to me that he and Tannajee have leagued together,
and&mdash;&mdash;; in short, they write foolish things, sir."</p>

<p>"Bhóslay? that is your family name, Bulwunt," said Fazil, musing.</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied, "and we are of the same house; but he is rich
and I am poor. And now people tell wonderful things of him; how
the Mother&mdash;that is, Bhowani, speaks in him sometimes, and he
prophesies great events. One thing is certain, Meah, Sivaji Bhóslay
is no friend to Beejapoor, nor to any Mussulman; and if Maloosray
has come here for him, it is with some object which is worth the risk
to discover."</p>

<p>"Then they are friends?" asked Fazil.</p>

<p>"Ay, Meah, as thou and I, and nearer still. Maloosray believes
Sivaji to be an incarnation of the gods, and would give his life for
him. So, too, many another; and the people have begun to write
ballads about him, which are sung in Beejapoor even sometimes,
and they set one's blood dancing. No wonder the people of the wild
valleys love them; wild places, Meah, which ye know little of as yet."</p>

<p>"Yes, it is worth the risk to find out what is doing. One thread
of those dark intrigues in my hand and I am not my father's son if I
do not discover more," replied Fazil; "but you said we should be
disguised."</p>

<p>The Mahratta thought for a moment. "What sayest thou, Meah,
to becoming a Hindu for the time? I could paint the marks on thy
forehead. Nay," he continued, as he saw the young man shrink
from the idea, "they will only be very temporary 'abominations,'
as the old Khan calls them, and water will remove them when we
return."</p>

<p>"Good," returned Fazil. "I will suffer 'the abominations' in the
cause of the Shah and the faith. And, now, begone. I will come
to thee here, after the evening meal, and we can dress unobserved.
But swear on my neck, Bulwunt, no more ganja to-night."</p>

<p>"No, no, Meah," returned the man, laughing, and touching his
young lord's neck and feet; "I swear I will not touch it. We both
need cool heads for this work, and I will not fail you."</p>

<p>"Then go," added Fazil. "I will send Goolab to you when I am
ready."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX.</a></h2>


<p>Fazil was as good as his word to his fair sister, and having seen
Bulwunt depart, gained the door which led to the private apartments,
and proceeded to that in which he knew he should find her.</p>

<p>The room was upon the first story, which, by means of deep stone
brackets, had been constructed so as to project somewhat over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
rooms beneath. It contained, indeed for the most part consisted of,
three large oriel windows, overhanging the line of the walls, so that
they commanded a view up and down the main street, which led to
Toorweh and the royal palaces. These windows were large enough
for several persons to sit in and enjoy the air; and the floor of the
centre one, which was the largest, was raised a step above that of
the room, so as to form a dais, on which a thickly-quilted cotton
mattress, covered with clean white muslin, was laid every day, and
furnished with large pillows, so that those sitting there could recline
luxuriously, if they pleased. Between the stone mullions of the
windows, carved screens or shutters of wood had been inserted,
which were fixtures, except a portion in the centre which opened on
hinges. Without them were heavy wooden shutters, lined with iron,
with openings to fire from should it be needed.</p>

<p>The other windows did not project so far, and were in fact single
arches, filled deep with carved latticework, closed during the day,
but open in the evening to admit the fresh air. Beside each was a
large Persian carpet and a pillow. The floor of the apartment had
also a thin carpet of quilted cotton cloth, covered with white muslin;
and the perfect neatness of the whole, the walls being pure white
without ornament, gave evidence of very vigilant superintendence
by the Khan's present wife, perhaps by Zyna herself. One lamp
burned in a corner, and, being agitated by the wind, which blew
freely through the apartment, gave a flickering light, which left
much of the space in actual gloom.</p>

<p>Zyna had been there some time, and the sweet freshness of the
evening air had tempted her to throw open the lattice window to
admit it more freely, as she sat in the balcony or oriel window
already mentioned. Looking out upon what was passing below her,
she did not observe her brother's entrance, and almost started as he
spoke.</p>

<p>"I did not hear thee, brother," she said, rising and making way
for him. "Come and sit here, it is so fresh after the rain. What
kept thee so late? We hear the Durbar was very full to-day, and
that there are more rumours of war. O, I pray not, brother?"</p>

<p>"True, sister, there are such rumours," he replied; "but nothing
new. The Wuzeer is at Nuldroog with the army. The Emperor's
forces lie about Dowlutabad, so there is no change. But I was not
in Durbar. I was looking after some other matters. Come and sit
here, Zyna, and I will tell thee. See," he continued, as she seated
herself by him, "the city looks calm and beautiful, does it not?
Yet, who can tell the wild acts now in progress there, and the wild
plots which disgrace it?"</p>

<p>In truth it was a fair scene. The house or palace of Afzool Khan
stood somewhat apart from other buildings, upon a slight eminence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
and the room they were in overlooked a large portion of the city to
the south, west, and north. Between the combined twilight and light
of a moon about half-full, the outlines of the city generally, and of
some of the most remarkable buildings, could be seen distinctly, and
formed a picture of great beauty. To the north, the large dome of
the mausoleum of Mahmood Adil Shah stood out boldly against the
clear grey sky, as well as the high dark masses of the King's palaces
in the citadel, and of that of the "Seven Stories" in particular, in
the windows of which lights already twinkled here and there, and
disappeared.</p>

<p>A little on the left of the palace was the massive cavalier of the
"Oopree Boorje," with the King's flagstaff on its summit; below,
the dark lines of the fortifications, with lights gleaming from each
guard-room upon the bastions. Thence the eye travelled round the
city, resting here and there upon massive domes and slender minarets,
shining tenderly in the moon's rays, which also fell softly upon the
outlines of terraced houses and palaces, and upon the dark masses
of foliage of their gardens. Over the most populous parts of the
city also nearer to them, the evening smoke hovered like a thin mist,
catching reflection of the thousand lights and fires beneath: and a
hum of voices arose from thence:&mdash;otherwise, all was still around
them, and the broad street leading to Toorweh nearly deserted.
Night was fast falling, and a bright star here and there already
sparkled in the sky.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is a fair scene, sister," he continued, as she drew closer to
him. "Yet, even now, men are plotting villany and treachery.
There is no peace in it."</p>

<p>"No peace, brother!" she said, echoing his words; "cannot
others be as we are&mdash;enjoying what Alla sends them without strife?
Why should it not be so?"</p>

<p>"Why, Zyna? because of ambition, which, with the hot thirst it
begets, dries up men's hearts; because of avarice, driving them to
barter kingdoms and honour for gold; because of fraud, and deceit,
and lies, and profligacy. Alas, girl, where ends the catalogue?
Even now I fear the evil thoughts and treacherous plots of our fair
city."</p>

<p>Zyna shuddered, and nestled closer to her brother. "Why is thy
speech so sad to-night, Fazil?" she said timidly; "does aught
threaten us or our friends?"</p>

<p>"Listen, sister, and judge," he returned. "I cannot help these
fancies. Ah, Zyna! if I had one like thee to be with me always&mdash;to
be more to me even than thou art&mdash;perhaps the world, fair as it
lies there, would have few charms for me."</p>

<p>"She would be forgotten before a bright sword or a gallant horse,
brother," replied Zyna, in a tone of raillery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not so, by the Prophet!&mdash;by your head and eyes; no, Zyna,"
cried her brother earnestly. "Let such an one come, and thou wilt
see what she would be to me."</p>

<p>"Would it were so, brother! and yet I know of no one&mdash;not one
as yet&mdash;whom thou couldst love like me. None of the maidens of
this city are worthy of thee; no, not one, Fazil."</p>

<p>"Ah! nothing less than one of the blessed houris of Paradise
would content thee for me," returned the young man, laughing;
"but one like thyself would quite content me, sister. Perhaps even
now thou hast been thinking I have some love-secret to tell thee,
for I have not accounted for my delay these two evenings, but love
there is none, dearest. No&mdash;none at all," as she shook her head and
laughed incredulously,&mdash;"none. A graver matter, truly, if I am
right. Listen, Zyna, I have told thee of Kowas Khan before&mdash;my
friend, the Wuzeer's son&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What of him?" she returned, so abruptly that her tone of
alarm startled her brother. "Yes," she continued, correcting herself,
"surely&mdash;often&mdash;dear brother, hast thou not told me of his
bravery when the Moghuls besieged the city? but do not mention
him, else I will go away."</p>

<p>"Nay, go not, Zyna. I will not tease thee," he replied, "yet why
should I not speak of him? Is he not a hero&mdash;a very Roostum?
Is he not beautiful?&mdash;a youth for a maiden to love, or a man to
make his friend! But enough of this," for he perceived the confusion
his last words had occasioned: "to say the truth, I am anxious
for the whole family, and there is much cause to fear; the Wuzeer
is not keeping his faith with the King. But for that, indeed&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush, brother!" said Zyna, again blushing, for she knew that
she had been sought in marriage by the Wuzeer for his son; "may
God forbid evil to him or any of them; and men have as yet spoken
well of him. Why should he be suspected?"</p>

<p>"Alas, who can say?" replied her brother sadly. "Who can tell
to what crimes pride and ambition may not urge a man? Truly,
sister, it will not be marvellous if the Wuzeer, seeing the danger of
the Moghuls on the one hand, of Sivaji Bhóslay on the other, and
knowing better than we do the divisions among our own nobles,
should forget his faith, and try to strike in for himself. 'Twas thus,
so writes the historian of honoured memory, Mahomed Kasim
Ferishta, that our own kingly house rose into existence, and the
Nizam Shahy and Kootub Shahy dynasties also; what wonder, then,
that Khan Mahomed&mdash;the rich, the honoured, the powerful&mdash;should
be tempted to follow examples so successful and so prosperous?"</p>

<p>"What! and forget his King, who has raised him from&mdash;from&mdash;&mdash;"
she could not add slavery; "forget honours, titles, lands, wealth?
O brother!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah, Zyna," returned Fazil, sighing, "believe me, there are few
minds so noble, and so humble too, as to despise power in little
things; how much less a position so exalted as that of monarch of
these noble realms. Men have already forgotten 'Rehân' the slave,
in 'Khan Mahomed,' the Wuzeer of Beejapoor. We know what he
was, we see what he is, and we can think what he might be. If he
is playing for the highest stake, it is a game in which his life is of
no account."</p>

<p>"I would I had not known of this, brother, from thy lips," said
Zyna sadly. "True, it seems to have a terrible distinctness: and
his son?"</p>

<p>"Nay, by your head and eyes, he is pure, Zyna. My own dear
friend," he exclaimed, "I would answer for him with my life. As
for the rest, 'tis but suspicion as yet. Whatever the matter I know
of may lead to, I am resolved to see the last of it. Listen.</p>

<p>"Last evening I was coming from the Durbar, and, dismissing
the men who were with me, I rode to some open ground to exercise
my horse. It is not far from the King's palace at Toorweh: and to
get there I proceeded through the outskirts of the city, which lead
to the quarter of the lower orders of the people. I had not ridden
far when I met the palankeen of the King's secretary, attended by
some horsemen. It seemed strange to meet him there, because,
when I left the audience hall, he seemed immersed in business. So
I rode up towards it with the intention of saluting him again,
when he shut the door as it were carelessly, but, as I thought, with
an evident desire not to be seen: this stimulated my curiosity. I
had no pretence for following him, only there happened to be an
acquaintance, who was in command of his escort, and who called
me. I joined him, unobserved by the Meerza, and accompanied him
under pretence of friendly chat. By-and-by, as the better part of
the town grew more distant, I asked him banteringly what had
brought so great a person as the King's Meerza into so mean a
quarter, and whether I might see the end of the adventure; and
looking about him&mdash;to be sure the rest of the escort were out of
hearing&mdash;he told me that, after leaving the court, the Meerza had
first gone to a respectable Hindu house in another quarter and
remained there some time; and when he came out he was attended
to the door by a Hindu soldier, who bade him depart, and told him
not to forget the shop of Rama of Ashtee, in the 'kullal's' quarter,
and Tannajee Maloosray. Thence a man was sent as guide to
another house, and he showed him to me then running with the
bearers before the palankeen. 'So I can only suppose it is some
work of the King's,' added my friend, 'with which we cavaliers have
nothing to do.' I thought otherwise, for Tannajee's name is famous;
and we rode on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>"After some time the guide stopped at the door of a decent
house, which I think was a Jungum's Mutt. The Meerza did not
get out of his palankeen, and a man came to the doorway and began
to speak in Persian, after having looked round suspiciously at all of
us. I shall not forget the man, Zyna, for he had piercing grey eyes
and a hooked nose. I suppose he thought no one could understand
him, for he did not speak low. Still, as his head was partly inside
the door of the secretary's palankeen, I could not hear all, and could
only approach, indeed, on pretence of my horse being restless. I
heard, however, the man's direction to the secretary, a Hindu
temple of Bhowani, in the plain on the east of the fort, where papers
were to be shown at midnight, and the Wuzeer's name was
mentioned. Thither I will go, 'Inshalla!' to-night. I can disguise
myself, and my speech is Mahratta or Canarese, as I please, and
Bulwunt Rao goes with me."</p>

<p>"Go not, my precious brother," said Zyna, interrupting him;
"there must be danger among these plotters. Remember what thou
art to us all, Fazil."</p>

<p>"If my love were not what it is for Khan Mahomed's son," he
replied, "I would not hazard this matter; but we, thy father and
myself, owe the Wuzeer many favours, and I should hold myself
false did I hesitate to peril something in their cause. Even thou,
Zyna, hast not forgotten how Kowas Khan and our brave Bulwunt
Rao fought over me when I had been stricken down in the Friday's
fight with the Moghuls, and but for them I had perished. Yes, sister,
I must go."</p>

<p>"Go? whither, son?" said Afzool Khan, whose entrance had not
been observed by either; "whither wouldst thou go, and for what?"</p>

<p>"Father!" uttered both at the same moment, and, rising, saluted
him reverently.</p>

<p>"Be seated, my children," he said; "I too will join you. Your
mother hath not been here?"</p>

<p>The allusion made was to their father's second wife, whom he
had married after the mother of his children died, and who received
from them all the honour and respect, if not the tender love, of
their real mother. Her name was Lurlee, to which her title of
Khánum being added, she was known among her friends and dependants
as Lurlee Khánum; and she will appear presently in her
proper person.</p>

<p>"No, father," replied Zyna, "she was going to cook something
for you, and had something to do with her tables; and said that
there was something going to happen, for that Mars and the moon,
or stay&mdash;really I don't know, father, how it was&mdash;I forget."</p>

<p>"Ah," returned her father, smiling, "bicharee&mdash;poor thing!&mdash;those
stars are a sad trouble to her. But what art thou going to do,
son?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>"Tell him all you have told me, brother," said Zyna.</p>

<p>Fazil recapitulated what he had told his sister, and finding his
father interested, again stated his intention of following up the
secret, whatever it might be.</p>

<p>"Go, my son," said the old Khan, "I cannot gainsay thee in this
matter. If we can protect Khan Mahomed or keep evil from his
house, or if any of these vile plots can be traced to those concerned
in them, a few sharp examples may deter others. But why not take
some of the Päègah? those are dangerous quarters by night."</p>

<p>"Impossible, father, they are too wary; and Bulwunt Rao says
there will be spies and scouts watching everywhere. So we are
better alone, and with your leave, father, I go to prepare myself."</p>

<p>Afzool Khan opened the casement, and looked out. He partly
leaned out of the window, and appeared to be gazing abstractedly
over the city. The young moon was now low in the sky, and the
stars shone out more brilliantly than before; but clouds were
gathering fast in the south-west, which, from the lightning flashing
about their tops, boded a storm. As yet, however, the gentle light
of the moon pervaded all, glinting from the bright gilded pinnacles
of domes and minarets, and resting tenderly upon the white terraces,
walls, and projecting oriels of houses near him&mdash;upon the tapering
minarets of his own private mosque, and the heavy but graceful
foliage that hung about them.</p>

<p>"It is a type of what is coming," thought the Khan&mdash;"here the
moonlight only partially dispelling the gloom, which will increase;
there heavy night-clouds already threatening. Even so with our
fair kingdom: the tempest of sorrow may break over us. We
cannot stop it, but we may at least endure the trial, and be true to
our salt."</p>

<p>He was long silent, and the beads which he had removed from
his wrist were passing rapidly through his fingers, while his lips
moved as though in prayer. Zyna dared not speak, yet he looked at
her lovingly as his lips still moved, and passing his arm round her,
drew her to him. Perhaps with that embrace more tender thoughts
came into his heart, some memories that were sad yet grateful.</p>

<p>"There will be no danger, Zyna," he said assuringly, as he felt
her trembling, and guessed her thoughts; "Fazil and Bulwunt Rao
are both wary. The moon, too, is setting, and it will be dark,
perhaps raining. He comes, daughter," continued the Khan, as
Fazil's foot was heard on the stairs; "let us look at him."</p>

<p>As he spoke, Fazil entered the room and made the Hindu salutation
of reverence to his father. "Should I be known as your son, father?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"Nemmo Narrayen Baba," cried Afzool Khan, laughing, and returning
the salutation in the same style. "If thou knowest thyself,
it is more than I can say of thee."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>The disguise was indeed perfect. Fazil was naked to the waist,
and a coarse cloth of some length, which might serve as a sheet if
unwound, was crossed upon his shoulders and chest in thick folds.
A long scarf of thick soft muslin was tied about his loins, leaving
his muscular arms bare and free. On his chest and about his neck
was a necklace, consisting of several heavy rows of large wooden
beads, which, with the cloth, might turn a sword-cut, while both
served to protect him from the damp night wind. About his head
was a turban of coarse cloth, and a strip of finer material, passing
under his chin, covered his mouth and eyes, and was tied in a knot
above his turban, leaving two hood ends hanging down on each side.
His face was smeared with white earth, and above his nose the
broad trident of Krishna was painted in white and red, covering
nearly the whole of his eyebrows and forehead. The loose
Mahomedan drawers had been changed for a Hindu waist-cloth, or
"punja," tied tightly about him, and reaching barely to his knee;
while the ends were rolled up, leaving his legs and most part of his
thighs bare, which, with his arms, were covered with brown earth
to subdue the fairness of the skin. The whole of his clothes were of
one colour, a deep reddish brown, which is called "bhugwa," and is
the sacred and distinctive colour of all religious devotees. At his
back hung a broad black shield with steel bosses upon it, and he
held in his hand a sabre with a plain steel hilt and black scabbard,
which his father recognized as a favourite weapon. Nothing could
have been better suited for his guise than the whole equipment, nor
was there anything left to desire in its perfect adaptation to resistance
or flight, should either be necessary.</p>

<p>"Bulwunt waits for me in the garden, and I go. Thy blessing,
my father," said Fazil, stooping forward.</p>

<p>"Go. May Alla, and the saints, and the holy Emaon Zamin protect
thee!" said the Khan, rising, and placing his hands tenderly on
his son's head. "Go, and return victorious!"</p>

<p>"Ameen! ameen!" (amen!) sighed Zyna, for her heart was with
her brother, as he turned to depart upon his perhaps perilous mission.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX.</a></h2>


<p>"You have not stayed long, Meah, after all," cried the cheery voice
of Bulwunt Rao, as he saw his young master approaching the place
of meeting, a large peepul tree, which stood at a back entrance to
the garden. "And you are as good as your word. I thought there
might be some lecture from 'the Mastu,' and some remonstrances
from the Khánum, and possibly that the stars were not to be
overcome; but all seems to have gone well. Did they know you?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>"My sister seemed rather frightened as she saw me, and shrank
back, but my father declared me perfect, and bade me God-speed,"
replied Fazil; "but look over me once more: dark as it is, it might
be a matter of life or death if we were discovered."</p>

<p>"Discovered, Meah! No, trust me for that!" replied Bulwunt.
"Only keep that courtly tongue of yours quiet, or if you speak at
all, let it be in Canara, which somehow suits you better than our soft
Mahratta, and let it be as broad as you can make it. Leave the rest
to me. 'Mahrattas know Mahrattas,' is one of our common proverbs,
not untrue either. No salaams, Meah! If there be occasion to salute
any one, you know the mode. So&mdash;join your hands and thumbs
together, carry them up to your nose. There, your thumbs along the
nose&mdash;good. Now a gentle inclination of the head, very little&mdash;&mdash;Shabash!
that was excellent. Take care that no Bundagee or
Salaam Alyèk&mdash;or other Moslem salutation escape you: if you have
need, a soft 'Numuscar Maharaj,' or if we meet a Gosai, 'Nemmo
Narrayen Bawa!' Or, better than all&mdash;why risk anything? keep a
silent tongue, and leave me to talk."</p>

<p>"Nay, not so fast, friend," cried the young Khan, smiling at his
follower's earnestness, "fear not for me; I know enough of the
customs of the dress I wear to bear me out if need be, and I would
fain have my tongue as my hands are&mdash;at liberty. No ganja, I
hope, since your brain is clear."</p>

<p>"By your head and eyes, no, Meah, I have only drunk water since
you first called me," he replied earnestly; "look here," and he
executed one of the most difficult of the movements which accompanied
his sword exercise,&mdash;"will that do?"</p>

<p>"Let us on then, friend, in the name of all the saints, for we have
enough to do ere morning, and it is some distance to the temple."</p>

<p>"Nearly a coss, Meah, and we have to pass some bad places
beyond the deer park. Come, let nothing induce you to enter into a
brawl, or notice insult, or we shall fail. If we are attacked, we can
strike in return. Come!"</p>

<p>So saying, they moved on rapidly and silently to the Hindu
temple which Bulwunt Rao knew of. Their appearance&mdash;for both
were attired as nearly as possible alike, except that Bulwunt had
concealed more of his face than his companion&mdash;was too common and
unobtrusive to attract attention, and they passed unnoticed through
the respectable portions of the city, meeting, however, few passers
in the now dark and deserted streets.</p>

<p>Passing the wall of the deer park, and skirting the walls and
glacis of the citadel, patches of open rocky ground succeeded, where
a few sleepless asses picked up a scanty night meal, and the houseless
dogs of the city snarled and fought over the carrion carcases of
cattle, or the offal which had been thrown out there, or disputed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
their half-picked bones with troops of jackals. Now they met men
at intervals, who, with muffled faces and scarcely concealed weapons,
watched for unwary single passengers, from whom by threat or
violence they might be able to extort the means of temporary debauchery.
Some such looked scowlingly upon the friends, and
sometimes even advanced upon them; but seeing at a nearer glance
no hope of anything but hard blows, passed them by unheeded.</p>

<p>"Many a good fellow has had an end of him made hereabouts,"
said Bulwunt in a low voice, as they passed a more conspicuous
group than usual, who seemed inclined to dispute the way with
them. "How much would there be found of a man by morning, to
ascertain what he had been in life, if his body were thrown upon
one of those heaps of carrion, which the hyenas, dogs, and jackals
are fighting over? Do you not hear them yelling?&mdash;Bah! that
would be an ugly fate, and that is why I seldom venture into this
quarter by night."</p>

<p>"Then you come sometimes?"</p>

<p>"Why not, Meah? Are there not adventures enough for those
who seek them? I tell thee, many a young noble, ay, and old one
too, that I could name, come here after dark and amuse themselves
gaily for an hour or two; but thou art not of that sort, Meah; else
I had brought thee long ago."</p>

<p>"And that is the quarter yonder, I suppose," said the young man,
"above which the light gleams brightly."</p>

<p>"You are right, Meah; a few minutes more and we enter it."</p>

<p>A scene it was of coarse open profligacy. Shops of a low character
for the sale of spirits were everywhere open, filled with flaming
lamps, or before which stood large iron cressets filled with cotton
seed soaked in oil, that burned brightly, sending forth a thick ropy
smoke, and showing groups of men, women, and children too, sitting
on the ground, drinking the hot new liquor, or the more rapidly
intoxicating juice of the date palm-tree; which, contained in large
earthen jars, was being dispensed by ladlesful to people clustered
around them. All this part resounded with obscene abuse, and
songs, and violent wrangling. In one group two men had drawn
their daggers, and were with difficulty held back by women hanging
about them. In another place, two women had hold of each other's
hair, and were beating and scratching each other with their disengaged
hands.</p>

<p>They passed through all; many a gibe and coarse invitation
familiar to Bulwunt Rao, who, had he been alone, could not have
resisted them, followed them from men and women. But he was
for the time steady, checked by the presence of his young chief, and
with the fierce desire of meeting his hereditary enemy burning
at his heart. They were now near the place in regard to which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
Bulwunt thought he could not be mistaken. A little further there
was a Hindu temple gaily decked out with white and orange-coloured
banners; people were singing evening hymns within it,
and their voices rose even above the hoarse murmur of the crowd,
and there was a clash of cymbals accompanying them. Bulwunt
stopped, and laid his hand on his companion's arm.</p>

<p>"That is the temple," he said, "by which I know the kullal's, and
that is where we shall meet Tannajee, if at all. That is Rama of
Ashtee's shop across the street."</p>

<p>"And is the other temple far off?" asked Fazil.</p>

<p>"Not now; a few more turns down the back lanes yonder, and
we shall find it among the tamarind trees in the plain. We will go
there at once."</p>

<p>Bulwunt knew the place perfectly. A quiet secluded spot, where
often, stupid from the effects of ganja, or drink, he had gone to
sleep off the effects before he went home. A place where one or two
Jogis, or Gosais, or Sunniasis of ascetic orders, usually put up, or
travellers sometimes going eastwards, who had to be clear of the city
before dawn. The grove, too, was a favourite place for encampment,
and droves of Brinjarries, or other public carriers, halted there in
fair weather. Now, however, it was quite vacant, and the natural
gloom of the place was deepened by the darkness of the night, while
the glare to which their eyes had been exposed, caused it to seem
more gloomy still.</p>

<p>"An evil-looking place, friend, at this hour," said Fazil.</p>

<p>"Ay, Meah, dark enough; yet better than the light we have left
yonder," he replied, pausing and looking back to where the glare of
the kullal's quarter rose into the dark night air above the houses;&mdash;"better
than that. Yet it is a strange place to come to at night,
unless there be any one here. Be cautious, Meah, I will look in."</p>

<p>The temple was a small one, upon a low basement; the high
conical roof or steeple could hardly be traced among the heavy
foliage that enveloped it. There was a court around it, the wall of
which was not so high on one side but that a man standing on tip-toe
might look over it; and as Fazil was about to do so, Bulwunt
Rao pulled him back.</p>

<p>"For your life, no," he whispered, "some one is there. I saw
the flicker of a fire yonder; come round to the back of the verandah.
I know of a hole in the wall which is not filled up."</p>

<p>Fazil followed. His companion was right. A hole had been left
in the wall for light or air, and some loose stones and bricks stuffed
into it. Just enough aperture remained for both to see plainly what
was therein. On two sides of the small court, opposite to the
temple, was a terraced building roughly built, the pillars supporting
the clay roof being of rudely-hewn timber. The basement was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
level with that of the temple, and ascended by three low steps in
the centre. Three persons were sitting on the floor near the embers
of a fire; two enveloped in white sheets, which were drawn over
their heads, and partly over their faces; they might be Brahmuns,
who had been worshipping at the temple. The other was a "Jogi,"
or ascetic, who, in all his majesty of dirt and ashes&mdash;his hair matted
and twisted about his head like a turban, the ends of a long grizzly
beard tucked over his ears, and naked to the waist&mdash;sat cross-legged
upon a deer's skin before the embers, which cast a dull and flickering
light upon his naked body.</p>

<p>Occasionally, with his right hand, he took ashes from the fire and
rubbed them over his broad hairy chest and sinewy arms, and
occasionally over his face, telling his beads the while with his left.
None of the men spoke. Could they be the persons of whom they
were in search?</p>

<p>"I fear we are wrong, Bulwunt," whispered Fazil, "these must
be Brahmuns with that Jogi."</p>

<p>"I know of no other temple, Meah," returned Bulwunt; "but
wait here, I will go round to the door and question them."</p>

<p>"Be careful, friend; I like not the look of the old Jogi; be careful,"
interrupted Fazil.</p>

<p>"Nay, I am not going to quarrel with him," continued Bulwunt
Rao; "but watch what they do. You will see all their faces if
they turn to me." And with cautious steps he moved in.</p>

<p>The door of the temple was in front. Bulwunt had seen it was
partially opened when they arrived. Fazil heard it creak on its
hinges as Bulwunt opened it, and saw him emerge from behind the
basement of the temple; and amidst a rough cry of "who comes?"
"who art thou?" from the three persons, walk slowly and firmly
up to the basement of the verandah, and make the customary
reverential salutation.</p>

<p>"Thou art a bold fellow," exclaimed one of the men covered
with a sheet, who stood up, looking at Bulwunt from head to foot,
"to intrude upon respectable people unbidden. A Gosai, too, whence
art thou?"</p>

<p>"I am a poor disciple of Amrut Geer, of Kullianee, if ye know
the town," answered Bulwunt, deferentially; "and they call me
Poorungeer. I have come to the city on business, and have travelled
far to-day. I often put up here, and, as I saw lights, I entered,
in the hope of shelter for the night. It will rain presently, and, with
your permission, I will take a drink of water and rest here."</p>

<p>"There is plenty of water in the well without," returned the
man sulkily; "and there are the iron bucket and cord&mdash;take them
and begone. There are a thousand Gosain's Mutts in Beejapoor,
why shouldst thou stay here?&mdash;begone!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nay, be not inhospitable, O Bawa!" returned Bulwunt. "I
am weary and footsore; it is a long way to the only Mutt, I know,
and it is not safe for a man alone to pass the plain at night."</p>

<p>"I tell thee begone," said the Jogi; "there is no room for thee
here; begone, else we will turn thee out."</p>

<p>"Direct me, then, to a resting-place, good sirs," replied Bulwunt.
"I would give no offence; I pray ye be not angry." "Nay," he
continued, observing a gesture of impatience; "behold, I am
gone. I would not be unwelcome. Only say, O Jogi, what this
temple is called?"</p>

<p>"This is the temple of Toolja Dévi, and dedicated to the Holy
Mother at Tooljapoor," replied the man. "If thou hast need to
visit it, come to-morrow, and thou wilt see the image. Depart now,
or these worthy men may be angry. Thou hast interrupted already
a discourse on the mysteries&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Which would have benefited me, Bawa, also. I shall not
forget their inhospitality. Now I depart." And saluting the Jogi,
who lifted his hand to his head, and staring fixedly at the others,
whose faces were plainly visible by the light of the fire, which had
blazed up, Bulwunt Rao left them.</p>

<p>"Listen, Meah," whispered Bulwunt to Fazil, as he rejoined him.
"These are the people, no doubt; there are some holes in the wall
behind them, which I saw when within; come round to them, we
shall see and hear better, and can listen to the old Jogi's discourse
on the mysteries; no doubt it will be edifying. The old Jogi is
some one, I think, in disguise, but it is well done. Come, and tread
softly."</p>

<p>The light tread of their naked feet was not heard amidst the
rustling of the trees above; and, as Bulwunt had said, there were
several holes in the wall which enabled them to see and hear perfectly,
except when the conversation was carried on in the lowest
whispers. They were, however, on the highest side of the court wall.</p>

<p>"We are right now," whispered Fazil; "but have the weapons
ready in case of need. I like not the Jogi nor his friends."</p>

<p>The inmates of the little building were silent for some time, and
one of them, who had kept his face concealed, at length lay down,
and drew his sheet over him. The other two smoked at intervals.
Now one, now the other, lighting the rude cocoa-nut hooka with
embers from the fire before them.</p>

<p>"Didst thou know that lad, Pahar Singh&mdash;that Gosai?" asked
his companion. "Methinks he was more than he seemed. I know
most of that old robber Amrut Geer's cheylas, too, but not him;
he may be a new one perhaps. Only I wish I had not seen him;
there was an evil eye in his head;" and the speaker's shoulders
twitched as though a slight shudder had passed through him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>"What dost thou care about evil eyes, Maun Singh?" replied
the Jogi, laughing. "I know not the man, and why should he
trouble thee, brother? Depend upon it he was no more than he
seemed, else why should he have named Amrut Geer of Tooljapoor?
Why art thou thus suspicious?" And he again applied himself to
the hooka, whose bubbling rattle rang through the building.</p>

<p>"Nay, it does not signify, only one does not like to be intruded
upon, that's all. I had as well shut the door of the temple, brother."</p>

<p>"Do not bolt it," cried the Jogi; "they will be here soon," as
the man went and closed it; then returned, and with another shrug
or shiver, lay down, when both relapsed into silence.</p>

<p>"Pahar Singh!" whispered Bulwunt to the young Khan; "the
robber, murderer, rebel, what you please. The man after whom we
wandered so long last year. Ah, 'tis a rare plot, Meah, if such be
the instruments."</p>

<p>"Hush!" said Fazil; "they are speaking again. Listen!"</p>

<p>"Where did you get those papers, O Toolsee Das?" asked Pahar
Singh of the man who had been lying down. "What, hast thou
been asleep? Tell me again, lest I make a mistake."</p>

<p>"Not I, please your Highness," replied the person addressed,
raising himself upon his arm; "but if you talk in that gibberish
language of your country, what am I to do? It is dull work
waiting when one's eyes are heavy with sleep, and I am not rested
from that fearful ride."</p>

<p>"Ha, ha, ha!" laughed Pahar Singh; "that ride, Lalla! O
man! it was but a child's ride after all, only forty coss. You will
be lively enough by-and-by. Now, if you can speak without lying,
tell me truly, are those papers genuine or not?"</p>

<p>"My lord," replied the Lalla, sitting up; "they who come will
best know that. If they had not been genuine they would not
have been worth the stealing, nor these long journeys, to which
your servant is not accustomed, nor the risk of being compared
with original documents. I told my lord this before, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"True, Lalla," said Pahar Singh, interrupting him; "but one
likes to hear a thing over again when it is pleasant. Ha, ha! when
it is pleasant, you know&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"When the honour of great houses is at stake we Mutsuddees
have to be proportionably careful," returned the Lalla pompously;
"and when your poor servant saw what these were, you see&mdash;my
consideration for the king&mdash;for this state&mdash;may it flourish a
thousand years&mdash;was great, and I&mdash;I, ahem&mdash;brought them
away&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You mean you stole them, Lalla? Out with the truth, good
fellow."</p>

<p>"Well, sir, if you don't like my words. Yes, I stole them, and it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
was a blessed chance which has enabled me to turn them to such good
account," said the Lalla, smiling blandly. "Excellent indeed, my
lord; and I," continued the Lalla, rubbing his hands, "ha! ha! my
lord, and I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ha! ha! ha!" responded Pahar Singh, interrupting him with
a coarse laugh. "We shall see. No blood in that robbery, Maun
Singh. Ours are seldom so neatly done, I think; but the Lalla is a
master of his craft. Well, and if they are genuine, you will have a
rich reward. O, much money; gold perhaps, who knows? and half
is mine for not cutting that lying coward throat of yours, or hanging
you like a dog, Lallajee."</p>

<p>"Noble prince, I have not forgotten the agreement, nor my lord's
hospitality," returned the Lalla, joining his hands.</p>

<p>"Ah, that is well," returned Pahar Singh grimly. "One should
not forget obligations, and they are only five days old. By your
child's head, Maun Singh, he had a narrow escape, only for the boy
and thee. Ah, it was rare fun. A coward&mdash;a peculiar coward!
He did not think he should live, and he told us of the papers; only
for that, they would have gone into the river with his carcase. Ah,
yes; it was well done. What if they are false, O Lalla, and we have
been brought so far in vain! O man, think of that."</p>

<p>"Yes, think of that, Lallajee," returned Maun Singh, turning
himself lazily round to speak. "There are few like thee who are
made guests of, and fed instead of becoming food. Ha, ha, ha! art
thou not afraid?"</p>

<p>"My lords, I can say no more. I have told you all I can, and the
rest is in their hands who come," said the Lalla, humbly putting up
his hands to his nose. In his heart, however, the man was chuckling,
secretly. He thought those who were to come would be attended
by a retinue, and he purposed to watch his opportunity and denounce
the robber, who would be seized on the bare mention of his name;
and when he, Toolsee Das, should not only get the price of the papers,
but, he felt sure, be rewarded for having enticed so wary a robber
into a trap. The Lalla, therefore, endured the raillery and coarse
abuse expended upon him with a peculiarly grim satisfaction.</p>

<p>"Yes, a cowardly knave, by your eyes, Maun Singh," continued
Pahar Singh, while both were laughing heartily. "Ah, how he
begged for life! And we have fed him well since too, though I am
not sure that I did right in bringing him here, after all. I think I
ought to have sent thee after thine ancestors, Lalla!"</p>

<p>"I doubt not, valiant sir, that your worship hath slain many of
the King's enemies," said the Lalla, trembling in spite of himself,
but inwardly determining to show no mercy, "and you are pleased
to be merry."</p>

<p>"Dog, if thou hast deceived me, and brought me fifty coss for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
nothing, to save thy miserable life," said Pahar Singh, fiercely, "thou
shalt not escape me twice. Hark! what is that at the door?" for
it was now shaken violently; "they are come, Maun Singh. Remember,
Lalla, I am no Pahar Singh now, or thou diest on the spot.
See what I have for thee here," and he showed the shining naked
blade of a sword concealed under the ashes. "Enough, don't be
frightened, only be discreet. Go, Maun Singh, brother, open the
wicket quickly," for those without again shook it impatiently. "Two
are to come, only the two; there might be treachery with more.
But ho, ho, ho! Pahar Singh is a match for ten, is he not? Now,
see thou speakest the truth, O Lalla," he continued; "and my vows
for the temple, and the well, they are not to be forgotten&mdash;nor&mdash;the
feeding&mdash;five thousand Brahmuns. Forget not this on thy life.
I am thy Gooroo, teaching thee 'the mysteries.'"</p>

<p>These words came from him, jerked out, as it were, by morsels,
during the brief interval that elapsed before those he expected
arrived; and which he employed in rubbing additional handfuls of
ashes from the edges of the fire upon his face, body, and limbs, so as
to render his disguise more complete, and in heaping up ashes on
his sword, the hilt of which lay towards him, ready for action. As
he finished, he took a string of wooden beads from his hair, and
settled himself on his heels, in an attitude of austere devotion; for,
after a brief parley at the gate, steps were heard advancing, and the
Lalla, though his heart sank within him at seeing only two persons
accompanying Maun Singh, rose as they ascended the steps of the
basement, and were clearly visible by the light of the fire, which
Pahar Singh had caused to burn brightly.</p>

<p>Fazil Khan's heart beat fast as he saw that one of the persons who
ascended first was the King's secretary, his most trustworthy and
confidential servant. His handsome, grave, Persian face, and long
grey beard, with the lameness he was known by, which resulted from
a wound, were unmistakable. The other, who had his face partly
concealed, and who might be taken for an ordinary attendant to the
Secretary, seemed nowise remarkable; but, as the pair sat down before
him, and this person removed one fold of the scarf about his face&mdash;though
he kept his mouth and nose still covered, as if to exclude
the night air&mdash;the large sad eyes of the young King were plainly
visible.</p>

<p>Fazil beheld him with an intensity of wondering interest, which it
is impossible to describe, and fairly panted with excitement. "If he
had known whom he was to meet here," he thought, "he would not
have exposed himself to this risk: Alla and the Prophet have sent
us." And as this escaped him, partly interjectionally and partly in
devout prayer, the young Khan seemed to swell with the consciousness
that his King might owe his safety, nay, even life, to them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>The Secretary was a veteran soldier, but he was unarmed, except a
small knife-dagger in his girdle. Fazil, therefore, loosened his sword
in its sheath. "Be ready," he whispered to his companion, who
pressed his hand silently, in acknowledgment of the caution. Bulwunt
had evidently not recognized the King; indeed, it was well
perhaps that he could not see the face, or have his suspicions
awakened: he might not have preserved the same composure as his
young master.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI.</a></h2>


<p>The silence was becoming oppressive, though only of a few moments'
duration, when Fazil observed the Jogi twitch the sleeve of the
Lalla's garment as a sign to begin. Though it had cost him a pang
to think he had no present hope of securing the robber, Toolsee Das,
in truth, was pretty much at his ease. The position and rank of the
King's secretary were unequivocal; who the other person might be,
he could not conjecture&mdash;perhaps an assistant, perhaps a son&mdash;he
might be either. There was something, certainly, in the look of those
great black eyes, which was uncommon; but they gave no response
to the Lalla's rapid but curious investigation of them: they could
not be fathomed at a glance.</p>

<p>There was nothing in the demeanour of either of the persons
before him to excite personal apprehension; and the Lalla was quite
sure that Pahar Singh would not give him up, or the papers either,
without an equivalent in money; and as he could not have Pahar
Singh taken, it was assuring to think that he need not be apprehended
himself, for it was quite certain that the robber would get
more for the secret here than if he and the papers had been conveyed
to the Imperial camp. There, a short questioning, and the executioner
would be sure; and the Lalla shuddered for an instant at the
thought of what would have followed. Here, as one who could give
information of the enemy, and who could disclose state counsels, to
what might he not aspire? If the people and their language were
barbarous in northern estimation, yet he had seen enough of the city
to be satisfied of its beauty; and were not many of the northern
people already settling among the Dekhanies?</p>

<p>Such thoughts were flashing rapidly through the Lalla's mind&mdash;far
more rapidly than we can write them&mdash;when he felt the sudden
twitch we have already mentioned: he joined his hands together,
and began, in a mincing accent, some of those courtly Persian phrases
of complimentary welcome, common to the Mahomedans of the north,
and which we need not repeat. The Secretary, however, was not in
a mood to endure them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>"Peace, Lallajee!" he said; "we are rougher people here than
those from whom you have brought these idle compliments, and you
can keep them till you get back. Now to business&mdash;do not detain
us."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes. My lord desired to see some letters of which I spoke
to him," he replied; "some that I mentioned yesterday."</p>

<p>"It is therefore that I have come, and it will be well if they can
be produced. You have higgled for them overmuch, good fellow,"
replied the Secretary, curtly.</p>

<p>"Nay, if my lord regrets," said the Lalla, "there is no need to
press the matter further. Baba!" he continued to the pretended
Jogi, "thou canst burn them in the fire there, only perhaps the
King&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not so fast, good sir," said the Meerza, speaking more blandly.
"I remember all that has passed between us and that valiant gentleman
yonder," and he pointed to Maun Singh, "and I am willing to
perform my part of the bargain. And is this the Gooroo of whom
ye spoke?"</p>

<p>"Sir, it is," replied the Lalla. "A holy man&mdash;one unused to the ways
of the world, and who travels from shrine to shrine in the performance
of sacred vows. Such were the Rishis; such are those from whom holy
actions emanate; and such are the virtuous Jogis of the present day,
of whom my Gooroo is a noble example. He, desiring the welfare of
the Shah&mdash;may his splendour increase, and live for ever!&mdash;sent me to
inform you, O fountain of eloquence and discretion! that they were
in existence&mdash;&mdash;" Here the Jogi gave another twitch of interruption,
and a look, with a low growl, which the Lalla well understood,
and continued&mdash;</p>

<p>"You see, noble sirs, he hath already suffered the interruption of
his devotional abstraction, and is uneasy; for he never speaks unless
to bless his disciples, or removes his eyes from the end of his nose: in
continuing which, and repeating to himself holy texts and spells of
wonderful power, he is pre-eminent in absorption of his faculties. So
my lord will excuse him, and will remember the condition attached
to the perusal of the papers."</p>

<p>"The gold, the gold&mdash;the money first!" growled the Jogi. "My
son, my vow, my vow!"</p>

<p>"Noble sirs," continued the Lalla in a deprecatory whine to both,
which appeared perfectly natural, as he looked from one to the other,
with his hands joined, "you must pardon him; he is not a man of
courts or of the world, but of temples, and holy shrines, and ascetic
exercises; and some time ago he made a vow to build a temple on a
spot where he had an ecstatic vision of heaven, and to dig a well, and
feed five thousand Brahmuns, and to pass the remainder of his days
in assisting poor travellers and in holy contemplation. A holy man,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
therefore, noble gentlemen, and he is anxious about the gold, not as
filthy lucre, but for the sake of the temple and the well."</p>

<p>"Peace!" interrupted the Meerza. "What, in the name of the
Shytan, are the well and the temple to us? Let us get up and
depart, Sahib," he said to his companion, "they have no papers;
this is but a scheme to raise money. I like them not, my lord,"
he added in a whisper, "and bitterly do I regret having brought you
here unarmed and unattended. May God and the Prophet take us
safe hence!"</p>

<p>The Lalla was not watching their faces in vain; he felt that he had
gone far enough; and a fresh scowl from Pahar Singh, which was
not to be mistaken: and his action, as he turned up a corner of the
deerskin on which he sat, exhibiting a small red satin bag which
might contain papers, assured the Lalla that he need not delay
longer.</p>

<p>"Nay, my lords, be not impatient," he said blandly. "When was&mdash;he,
he!&mdash;business of importance ever well done in a hurry? Behold!"
added the Lalla, taking up the bag, "here are the papers
which the holy father has kept safely for me beneath his deer's hide.
Have I your permission to open them, Baba?"</p>

<p>"Open, and be quick," was the short answer of the Jogi.</p>

<p>"Simply then, noble sirs," continued the obsequious Lalla, taking
some Persian letters out of the bag, "here they are; and if either of ye
know the handwriting, the signature, or the seals of Khan Mahomed,
Wuzeer of Beejapoor, he will, Inshalla! be able to recognize them.
I do not know them myself, but that makes no difference; they are
no forgeries. If you, my lord," he added to the Meerza, "know them,
you will find that your poor servant has spoken the truth. Look at
them carefully."</p>

<p>The Meerza received the packet with trembling hands, but he said
firmly, "Thou knowest the penalty thou hast incurred if these be
forged; and if a slave like thee shouldst have dared to question
falsely the honour of one so exalted as the Wuzeer, beware!"</p>

<p>"I know&mdash;I know, O most exalted and worthy sir!" replied the
Lalla, humbly but confidently shutting his eyes, folding his hands
upon his breast, and bowing his head over them; "your worship told
me before it would be death. But it will not be so. O no! In your
poor slave's destiny is written favour and advancement at your hands,
and his planets are in a fortunate conjunction."</p>

<p>"I would hang him to the highest tree in Beejapoor, to the topmost
branch of the Goruk Imlee, to feed the crows and kites for a
week. What a rascal he is, Meah!" whispered Bulwunt.</p>

<p>"Hush, and be ready! there is a life on every word," returned
Fazil, hearing the King speak in Persian in an under-tone to the
Meerza.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>"There is no escape from death," he said in a sad tone, "if these
papers be not false."</p>

<p>"True!" exclaimed the Jogi, abruptly, but whether it had reference
to the Lalla's speech or the King's, could not be certain. The
King looked at him suspiciously, but the man appeared once more
to have relapsed into abstraction.</p>

<p>"O, that I know, worthy sir," returned the Lalla carelessly,
"we must all die in the end: we are all mortal: what saith Saadi?"
and he quoted a verse from the Bôstan. "I have no fear of them,
noble gentlemen! May it please you to look at them first, and then
determine about killing me afterwards. He, he, he!"</p>

<p>"He does not tremble under those eyes," whispered Fazil to his
companion. "This must be true. God help them all!"</p>

<p>"If there be faith in handwriting and seals," resumed the Lalla
after a pause, "I fear not. If these documents had not been so
precious, why should the asylum of the world, my master, have kept
them so carefully in his own writing-case? The time is not come,
O Meerza! but you will yet hear of a reward having been set upon
your poor slave's head. Be it so; I claim the protection of Ali
Adil Shah for the service I now do him, Bismilla! Open the
packet there, and say whether I have death and infamy before me,
or life and honour in the King's service, for there is more at stake
in this matter than my lord knows of. Bismilla! open it."</p>

<p>The Meerza held the packet irresolutely, as one who almost feared
a knowledge of its contents, and looked for a moment to his companion&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Bismilla!" said the King, eagerly speaking in Persian, "open
it; this suspense is intolerable. Dost thou fear for Khan Mahomed?
art thou his friend?"</p>

<p>"By your head and eyes, by the King's salt, no," answered the
other. "For good or for evil, Bismilla! I open it,"&mdash;and he tore
the cover hastily.</p>

<p>The heart of Fazil Khan beat so hard in his bosom that its throbbings
seemed painfully audible to himself, and he almost fancied they
must be heard by all inside; but he was still, as was also his companion.</p>

<p>As the wax-cloth covers were withdrawn, there appeared several
letters in the bundle,&mdash;large, and the paper covered with gilding,
such as are sent to persons of the most exalted rank only. Eagerly,
most eagerly, did the practised eye of the Secretary run over each
superscription, and each was narrowly scrutinized. One by one he
passed them to the King, and Fazil could see that, whatever they
were, they caused the deepest expression of interest in both their
countenances. Suddenly the Meerza came to one which, having examined
even more narrowly than the others, he passed on, with a
deep sigh, to the King.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>It was taken eagerly, and at once opened and read, while the
Lalla turned from one to the other with an intense expression of
curiosity, fear, and hope blended together, marked on his features.</p>

<p>"Does that Jogi understand Persian, thinkest thou?" asked the
King of the Lalla.</p>

<p>"Not a word, I will answer for it with my head," returned the
man confidently. "How should he?"</p>

<p>"And thyself?"</p>

<p>"Surely, excellent sir; I have long served in the royal Dufter,
else how should I have known what to take and what to leave?"
He spoke now in Persian, and the conversation continued in that
language.</p>

<p>"If there were more, why didst thou not take all, Lalla?" asked
the Meerza.</p>

<p>"All, Meerza Sahib? that the theft might be discovered before
I had time to get away? Ah, no, good sir! A Mutsuddee may be
a rogue, but he should have discretion," and he quoted the Persian
proverb to that effect; "and to all appearance the royal desk still
holds the same packet which I made up with other papers, and
sealed with the private signet as it was before. No; the theft is not
suspected yet, unless that packet have been opened by the Emperor
when I was missed&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And thou knowest the contents of this letter, Lalla?" inquired
the King.</p>

<p>"I could say them to you, for I have them by heart, noble sir;
perhaps they are somewhat remarkable, for when I read them, I
thought Ali Adil Shah would like to hear them, so I committed
them to memory. I will even repeat the letter to you if this worthy
Meerza have no objection. I presume," he continued to the Secretary,
"that your friend is in the King's confidence as much as yourself."</p>

<p>"Surely," was the reply. "I may say that he is more in it than
I am myself, else I had not brought him."</p>

<p>"Enough," said the Lalla; "I am satisfied. Now, open the letter
and compare it with what I repeat. There is no Alkab."</p>

<p>"True," said the King, "he has drawn a Mudd at the top."</p>

<p>"Proceed after the Mudd, then," continued the Lalla, "the letter
runs thus:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<i>It has been the will of the all-powerful that the forces of my lord,
the ruler of both worlds, should retire. Let not that trouble his heart.
By the favour of the most merciful, matters will yet take a prosperous
course for my lord's true interests. All here, with this poor suppliant
for his bounty, are day and night labouring in his behalf: and already
many, as by the endorsed list, with their adherents, have been gained</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span><i>to the true cause. Others demur, but will repent; again, others are
obstinate, and cannot be moved, but they are not many. A few months
more, and when the season opens, the harvest will be ripe for the gathering.
Then, there will be no turning back for my lord from this city;
for its people, with this poor servant, rejoicing to escape tyranny, will at
once turn to the asylum of the two worlds, and give my lord's fortunate
footsteps a happy welcome. We are tired of the false religion; and as
to the King, he is but yet a boy, and has neither power, knowledge, nor
any friends: and are men of venerable age to submit tamely to his idle
fancies? Surely not. He can be ultimately provided for. For the
rest, my lord's promises are undeserved by the least of his servants, who
is not fit to kiss his feet; but my lord can at least rely that his
administration will be carried on entirely in his interest, and to his
honour and glory. What need to write more? it would be beyond the
bounds of respect. May the splendour of dominion and honour increase!
The signature of Khan Mahomed, Wuzeer of Beejapoor.</i>"</p></blockquote>

<p>"Ay, what need of more?" sighed the young King. "Enough
here&mdash;enough to prove the man's treachery, the least deserved that
ever the false world saw. Yet, Meerza, there are still many true to
the King: there are some suspected ones in the list that we know
of," he continued, his eye running rapidly over it, "but Afzool Khan,
and many of note, are not here, and yet rumour has assailed them
also."</p>

<p>"Yes, they are intimates," said the Secretary, "but no more, I
think."</p>

<p>"Then I have won my reward and my life!" exclaimed the Lalla
anxiously, in his own tongue.</p>

<p>"Your life, surely," replied the Meerza; "but for the reward, we
need to make some further scrutiny into those papers ere that can
be disbursed: they must be compared with others in the King's
possession. Therefore I will take them with me to-night, and if
you will come to me&mdash;you know my house&mdash;early to-morrow, all
will be arranged to your satisfaction."</p>

<p>"But, my lord&mdash;noble sirs," cried the Lalla, in evident dread,
"that was no part of the bargain. Did we not settle&mdash;&mdash;" He
could not, however, finish the sentence on account of a rude and
decisive interruption.</p>

<p>"I forbid it. I forbid one paper or one of you passing hence this
night till the money is paid," said the Jogi, severely.</p>

<p>"And who art thou?" demanded the Meerza, haughtily. "Peace!
withdraw; this is no place for thee, or the like of thee."</p>

<p>"Who am I?" retorted the ruffian. "Who am I? One who
has the right, as he has the power, to demand what he seeks." And
as he spoke he snatched from beneath the heap of ashes before him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
the heavy sword he had kept concealed there, which flashed brightly
in the firelight, and started to his feet, as did also his follower.
"Stir not!" he exclaimed to the King and Secretary, who had been
too much startled by the sudden action to rise with the Jogi; "stir not,
or ye die on the spot!" Drawing himself up to his majestic height,
Pahar Singh laughed scornfully. "Ha, ha, ha! a boy and a penman
against me! Ha, ha, ha! put up thy weapon, Maun Singh, there
is no need of it."</p>

<p>"Who art thou?" demanded the King, rising notwithstanding
the threat, and returning the glance as steadily as it was given.</p>

<p>"It concerns thee not," answered Pahar Singh. "Pay me the
money promised on those papers&mdash;ten thousand good rupees&mdash;on
this spot, or you pass not hence alive. Brother," he added to Maun
Singh, "be ready. They have brought the money, and we must get
it."</p>

<p>It was a moment of intense anxiety to Fazil Khan and his companion.
A word&mdash;a sound from them, and the life of the young
King was gone. Fazil could see that, except a small dagger in each
of their girdles, the King and his Secretary were unarmed. To rush to
them soon enough to be of use, was a thing impossible; they would
be dead ere he could strike a blow. There was no absolute peril,
however, as yet, and too much at stake to risk anything. Pahar
Singh appeared to have no evil intention; but, if provoked, it was
plain he might do violence, and would not hesitate to use his weapon
if rescue were attempted.</p>

<p>The King saw his danger. There was little avail in temporizing,
and his thought and action were alike prompt. His own life and
his friend's were both at stake; and what did the money signify?
Not a feather in the balance. Could his attendants, whom he had
left at a distance, even hear of his danger, he must perish ere they
could approach him.</p>

<p>"Hold!" he cried, "whoever thou art, Jogi. If the Lalla says
thou art to have the money, it will be given. Our bargain was with
him."</p>

<p>"And his with me," returned the man. "Give it me;" and as
he spoke he advanced close to the King.</p>

<p>"Pay it to him&mdash;let him have it," cried the Lalla to the King,
"and keep back your men if you have any with you, else there will
be bloodshed. He is desperate, noble sirs; do not provoke him."</p>

<p>"I would do him no harm," said Pahar Singh to the Secretary,
"but it is as well to be certain in case of treachery;" and he drew
a small dagger from his girdle with his left hand, and held it in an
attitude to strike into the King. "Go, if the money is here; bring
it quickly; but beware of any attempt to rescue him, or you will
cause his death. You could not reach me ere I had struck him down.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
Go then, Meerza Sahib, my friend Maun Singh will bring the bags:
he is strong enough."</p>

<p>"Go, friend," said the King, "do as he says. If the people ask
questions, say I am safe, and will be with them presently."</p>

<p>"And leave thee with him!" said the Meerza, anxiously. "I
will not stir; there is peril, and my place is beside thee."</p>

<p>"There is no peril if ye are true," said Pahar Singh; "much, if
ye are false. Go!"</p>

<p>"Go, friend, I will trust him; his object is money, not my poor
life. Go! I am not afraid of him, nor he of me," said the King.</p>

<p>"How noble he is!" whispered Fazil to his companion.</p>

<p>Both would have given all they possessed to have been by the
King's side to have struck down the ruffian.</p>

<p>"Ay, Meah, I would we were by his side," returned Bulwunt.
"Who can he be? Whoever he may be, he is indeed fearless; but
he will not be harmed if they bring the money. Hush! they may
speak again."</p>

<p>The Meerza turned silently to go, and descended the step, accompanied
by Maun Singh.</p>

<p>"Come," said the latter to the Lalla; "help to carry the bags,
good man; it will save me another journey. Come!"</p>

<p>The Lalla followed, and the two remained standing face to face,
the young King and the outlaw looking steadily at each other.</p>

<p>"Afraid of thee?" said Pahar Singh in a low voice, and dropping
the arm which had held the dagger uplifted. "Afraid of thee?
No, proud boy: he who defied thy father's power at its greatest, hath
little to fear from thine. Ali Adil Shah, thinkest thou that this
poor disguise could conceal thee? Yet thou art bold and true, and
I rejoice that I have had proof of it, for men told me thou wert a
coward&mdash;a boy of the zenana&mdash;only fit to herd with women. Now
thou hast met the 'Lion of the Hill' bravely," he continued, using the
play on his own name, "and he will turn from thee peacefully. Thy
life hath been in my hand&mdash;nay, is now in it were I to strike&mdash;but I
give it to thee freely; promise me mine in return, and swear by thy
father's spirit that, once gone from this, thou wilt not turn back,
nor suffer any one of thy retinue to do so."</p>

<p>The King started as the man covertly declared his name, and the
covering fell from his face.</p>

<p>"Thou Pahar Singh, the Lion of Allund?" he said.</p>

<p>"Even so, monarch," returned the chief. "Ha! ha! The man
whom thy slaves&mdash;cowards&mdash;tell thee they pursue. Aha! they dare
not. Pahar Singh is monarch of his own wilds; no royal troops
dare to come near them. But keep thine own counsel, and now listen.
Thou mayst need me yet, and I may do thee good service. Two
thousand good hearts and stout arms, such as thy money cannot hire,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
serve Pahar Singh. Swear to keep faith with me, and I will be true.
Hadst thou been a coward, and quailed at the sight of this weapon,
I should have been tempted to slay thee, Adil Khan, like a dog, for
never yet did coward sit on the throne of Beejapoor. For what has
happened, thou hast my respect. Enough! remember Pahar Singh,
and in two days or less I will send thee more tidings, or come myself.
Thou mayst kill the messenger, but he will not tell of my hiding-place;
and if harm come to him, I swear to thee, by the Lady of
Tooljapoor, my Holy Mother, that I will take a life for every hair
of his head, and burn a hundred villages. Now, silence! I have
spoken. Am I free to go, scathless as thou art? Thy hand upon it,
monarch!"</p>

<p>It was frankly given, and the rebel and outlaw, instead of taking
it rudely, and as if prompted suddenly by a kindly feeling of reverence
for his King, bent his head gently, touched it with his forehead, and
kissed it.</p>

<p>"Thy hand has touched my lips&mdash;put it upon my head, and swear
by thy father not to harm me," he said, quickly.</p>

<p>"I swear by my father not to harm thee, Pahar Singh: only be
thou henceforth faithful to thy King's salt," he replied, as he placed
both his hands upon the outlaw's head.</p>

<p>"Enough," returned Pahar Singh, removing them, pressing them
again to his forehead, and kissing them reverently; "I will be true
to thy salt, O King; but speak to no one of me, and wait patiently
till I come&mdash;I may have news for thee. A fakeer's rags and a beggar's
cry admit me everywhere&mdash;'Ulla dilâyâ to léonga'<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>&mdash;by night or
by day, wherever thou art, in durbar or zenana, whenever you hear
it&mdash;admit me, or order me to be confined, and send for me&mdash;I shall
bawl loudly enough. If I come not in two days, do not doubt me;
but stir not in this matter till I arrive&mdash;it may be very soon, I cannot
say. Now cover thy face; they come," and he resumed his former
threatening attitude.</p>

<p>The Meerza, with the two others, emerged from behind the temple
almost as he spoke, and in a few moments had ascended the steps of
the apartment. Maun Singh drew a heavy bag from beneath the
scarf which was round his shoulders; but the eye of the robber at
once detected its small size.</p>

<p>"Those are not rupees, Meerza; beware of treachery with me.
I have not harmed him," he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"No, it is gold, holy Baba. Behold!" and he opened the bag,
and poured the contents carefully into a little heap on the floor near
the fire. "There is more than <i>he</i> bargained for," he continued,
pointing to the Lalla, "but it does not matter; you are welcome to
it, for the temple and the well."</p>
<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>
<p>"Enough," returned Pahar Singh; "I am satisfied. Go, take
your papers, and begone; molest me no more." And, sitting down
on his deer's hide, he heaped up the gold coins carefully with his left
hand, while his right still held the sword.</p>

<p>"And my reward, O Meerza Sahib!" cried the Lalla eagerly, as
he and the King turned to depart; "thou wilt not abandon me to
him."</p>

<p>"It is there with the rest," answered the Secretary; "Lallajee,
help yourself, we must begone."</p>

<p>"Nay, but I want it not; only take me away&mdash;take me away.
I fear him," cried the man, in a piteous voice, and trembling
violently.</p>

<p>"Peace, fool," exclaimed Pahar Singh, rising and holding him
back powerfully. "Peace, I will settle with thee!"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII.</a></h2>


<p>For a moment the natural presence of mind which Fazil possessed
deserted him, and his brain seemed to reel under conflicting
thoughts, and the weight and importance of the secret of which he
had become possessed. Should he disclose himself to the King as
he passed out, and urge him to allow Pahar Singh to be taken?
The retinue which awaited the monarch would be enough to surround
the temple, and the robber's capture or death was certain.
It was a deed to do to prove his devotion, and the country would be
free of a bold and mischievous marauder, who plundered it up to
the gates of the city. But the King's promise to the outlaw was
for the time sacred, and there was, perhaps, further service to be
done by the man, which could not be delayed. As regards the
Wuzeer and his family, also, he must avow his knowledge of the
secret to the King, when he might be charged as his spy, and
so share the Wuzeer's fate. These thoughts checked the impulse
which had so nearly carried him on,&mdash;it might have been to
destruction.</p>

<p>"Shall we follow him? shall we speak to the King?" asked
Bulwunt hurriedly, observing Fazil's irresolution. "Say quickly,
Meah,&mdash;we have not a moment to lose."</p>

<p>"No, no! we are better here," replied Fazil. "The avowed
knowledge of that secret might chance to be our death-warrant; and
has not the King given him kowl? Let us watch still&mdash;we may
gather further particulars; but to follow the King is madness.
Listen! they are speaking." Again, therefore, they resumed their
respective positions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>A few sticks had been thrown on the embers, and Maun Singh
was kneeling down and blowing them into a flame, which, bursting
through them in small flashes with every breath, partially illumined
the figures around it and the blackened walls of the apartment.
Pahar Singh sat with the gold coins before him, counting them one
by one. A large portion were already laid on one side, which he
proceeded to drop into the bag. The expression of his coarse and
savage features could now be distinctly seen; for not only was the
light from the fire becoming steady, but he had removed from his
original position, so that he sat with his face nearly full towards Fazil,
though from Bulwunt Rao he was more concealed than before. It
was a face which, once seen, could never be forgotten. Men saw it
and quailed before it: women saw it and shuddered: and Fazil
remembered how often old Goolab, when he was yet a child, had
frightened him by the mention of Pahar Singh: while tales of his
occasional frays and bloody deeds were of everyday report in the
bazar.</p>

<p>There, then, he sat. Turban he had none: his matted hair,
twisted into a rough rope, was tied in a knot on the crown of his
head, and covered with ashes, showing the high narrow forehead&mdash;on
which, though crossed by deep wrinkles, the forked veins,
swelled by his excitement, stood out like ridges, betokening passions
wild, fierce, and uncontrollable. The eyes, always bright, glittered
restlessly and suspiciously from beneath the heavy brows, to which,
and to the lids, the white ashes, smeared on his face from time to
time as he sat, had adhered; and his hard grin disclosed the
prominent eye-teeth, which he chose to call tusks, in allusion to his
name.</p>

<p>When we last saw this face at Itga, it was excited, but there was
a softening influence exercised by the presence of his adopted son,
and Pahar Singh was under some restraint. Now there was none,
and it was difficult to recognize the features at all under his disguise,
which served to increase the natural ferocity of the expression.</p>

<p>His rough moustaches, of a sandy-brown colour at the ends, mingled
with a straggling scanty beard, were usually parted in the middle,
and turned over his ears; but now, being loosened, they were tied together
in a knot under his chin, in the most approved Jogi fashion.
His broad chest was covered with grizzled hair of the same peculiar
colour as his beard; and his chin, originally fair, had become of a
deep brown, except where it retained some of its original colour.
His arms, which had appeared so muscular when he suddenly started
up to threaten the king, seemed even longer and more powerful, as
he sat stretching out one over the blaze, while the fingers of the
other hand played among the gold pieces before him. Pahar Singh's
countenance was now very repellant. It seemed to Fazil that mercy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
could never issue from those pitiless lips which, with the full nostrils
distending and contracting rapidly under the action of feelings not
yet expressed, produced an effect which fascinated, while it shocked
one unused to it.</p>

<p>"Lallajee," he said, every now and then looking up: "O friend,
dost thou love gold? See, this is red and pure&mdash;ah, yes, lovely&mdash;and
so it need be, coming out of the King's mint direct. More than ten
thousand rupees, too, they said. Well, there are just five hundred
and fifty ashruffees. That is&mdash;how much, Maun Singh? thou art a
better accountant than I am."</p>

<p>"Somewhere about eleven thousand rupees, I believe, Maharaj,"
said his follower.</p>

<p>"Well, that will do, Lallajee," continued Pahar Singh. "That is
my share for taking care of thee, thou knowest, and getting thee a
good market for thy papers. The gods be praised! I vow ten of
these to the Holy Mother's necklace at Tooljapoor," and he took up
ten pieces of the number that remained.</p>

<p>"Nay, valiant sir," interposed the Lalla: "that is your Excellency's
share in the bag yonder. These are mine, not half, as we
agreed, but enough perhaps for the poor Lalla. It would be no
merit for my lord if he were to give to the goddess&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He could not finish the sentence, whatever it might have been
intended to mean, for the rude interruption&mdash;"Ill-begotten!" cried
the robber, snatching a brand from the fire and striking the Lalla's
hand, which had advanced towards the heap,&mdash;"dare to touch the
gold, and thou diest! That for the like of thee!"</p>

<p>"I am your slave," whimpered the man, wringing his hand;
"but why did my lord strike so hard?"</p>

<p>"Listen to the coward, brother," said Pahar Singh with a sneer;
"a woman would not whine like that. Now, thy share, Maun
Singh."</p>

<p>"Of course," said that worthy, "after being dallal in the matter,
and putting my head into jeopardy, running after that mad Secretary
into the very palace&mdash;where, had any one chanced to recognize me,
I should have been cut down or speared like a mad dog&mdash;truly,
considering the risk, and that day and night's ride to boot, mine
comes next. Ah! thou art a just man, O Jemadar."</p>

<p>"Well, then, hold out thine hand, brother," returned Pahar
Singh, taking up a few coins and dropping them into his hand.
"One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Good gold, good
gold, Lallajee!" he said, looking up: "but it is of no use giving it
to him: he will only spend it on women and liquor. Better I
should have the rest, who can take care of it, Lalla, and give it him
as he needs it&mdash;dost thou not think so? Yet, stay, I may as well&mdash;nine,
ten, that's two hundred rupees, brother&mdash;enough for thee.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
Who would have thought of a bundle of old papers bringing so
many bright ashruffees. And after all, O Lalla&mdash;by your head&mdash;were
they true or false, O mean thief?"</p>

<p>"True; I swear by your head and eyes, by the holy Krishna and
his temple at Muttra. Canst thou doubt, after what has passed, O
Jemadar?" cried the Lalla earnestly.</p>

<p>"Nay, how could I understand thy jabbering of Persian? That
was no honest talk, Maun Singh; they meant to cheat us by it, and
this slave joined in it. Twenty-one, twenty-two,"&mdash;he was counting
the remainder of the gold, and dropping the coins into his own bag
as he spoke, "twenty-three. Dost thou think, O Lalla, that I am a
cheating Mutsuddee, like thyself?&mdash;twenty-four, twenty-five.&mdash;Ill-begotten
clerk, say&mdash;am I&mdash;Pahar Singh&mdash;a liar and a thief like
thyself?"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"May I be your sacrifice, Maharaj, no," cried the Lalla, terrified
at his manner, and watching, with evident and ill-concealed uneasiness,
coin after coin disappearing into the bag. "Why should
my lord be angry if I spoke in Persian?"</p>

<p>"Ho, ho, thou art frightened again&mdash;art thou? Well, perhaps
thou couldst not help the Persian, as the letter had to be read;
but I understood it all the time, O Lalla. Thou couldst not have
cheated me&mdash;listen!" he continued in that language, speaking it
with a broad Mahratta accent; "what part of this sum dost thou
expect for thy share&mdash;twenty-six, twenty-seven. There is yet much,
Lalla. What sayeth the poet Saadi? Expectation&mdash;&mdash;No matter,
I forget the verses we used to learn at school. How much?"</p>

<p>"Nay, Maharaj, I know not," returned the man in a bewildered
manner. "My lord said half would be mine, and the Meerza told
us there were more than ten thousand rupees."</p>

<p>"Good, O Lalla, thou patron of valiant men like me: but dost
thou expect it? Five thousand rupees! dost thou think that such
a sum will come to thee?" and his hand passed to the hilt of his
sword.</p>

<p>"My lord! noble prince! I&mdash;I&mdash;I," stammered the now trembling
wretch. "I&mdash;I&mdash;mean the promise to me. Nay, look not so,
Maharaj," as he observed the robber's face distorted with suppressed
rage, the veins of his forehead swelled, and white foam gathering
about the corners of the mouth. "Nay, look not so angry! Behold,
I kiss your feet: I am a very poor man, and a stranger;" and he
joined his hands in supplication as he rose from his heels partly to a
kneeling posture. "Would my lord ever have known of the value of
those papers had I not told it? Would they not have been thrown
away, scattered to the winds, if my poor life had been taken at Itga?"</p>

<p>"My promise!&mdash;my promise to thee, O son of a base mother!
Didst thou not swear to me they would be worth thousands?&mdash;lakhs!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
cried the robber, raising his voice and gesticulating
violently, as he now took up the gold pieces by handfuls, and thrust
them into the bag. "A lakh of rupees! and here are only a few
paltry coins, for which thou hast brought me fifty coss! What will
Anunt Geer of Kullianee say to this poor instalment on his debt?
Thief! get me the rest&mdash;the rest of the gold they have put aside for
thee. Didst thou not promise a lakh?"</p>

<p>He had now lashed himself into a fury, which had been his object
evidently from the first; and he struck the Lalla with his clenched
hand violently upon the head, so that he fell backwards, and lay
apparently stunned; but it was only fear.</p>

<p>"He will kill him&mdash;not that he does not deserve death, the mean
hound!" said Fazil Khan, hurriedly to his companion. "When
was Pahar Singh ever known to spare a victim? What is to be
done, Bulwunt? shall we attack them?"</p>

<p>"Alas, Meah!" returned the other, "what can be done?&mdash;a
sound, a word, and the man is dead. We cannot reach them; and
the door was closed and barred when the others went. Ai Bhowani!
ai Khundôba! ai Bhugwân! save him! O, that I had brought my
gun with me, or even a pistol, Meah; but he dare not kill him; he
is only frightening him out of the money. Hush, and listen!"</p>

<p>"Raise him, brother," continued Pahar Singh to his companion,
laughing; "we will soon see whether this fear is true or feigned; or
is the coward soul really gone out of his body?"</p>

<p>"Nay, Jemadar, but he breathes," said Maun Singh, raising the
Lalla. "Speak, O Toolsee Das! art thou alive?"</p>

<p>"My lords! O my lords!" gasped the terrified wretch; "what
have I done? what have I done? why am I beaten?"</p>

<p>"My thousands, I tell thee!" cried the robber hoarsely. "Where
are the papers that were to bring me thousands? Thou hast concealed
them to sell to others. Liar! liar, and base-born coward, as
thou art!&mdash;--Enough, Maun Singh," he continued, in another language,
which was not understood either by Fazil Khan or his
companion, and which both often thought of afterwards; "he must
die; the goddess has sent him; he must die for her, lest he lead
other men astray."</p>

<p>"Ay, he is good Bunij, Jemadar," returned the man coolly.
"Methinks this would have saved trouble long ago, and your
worship's getting into a passion. We ate the goor this morning&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Surely, brother, but no blood. I would not soil my sword with
carrion like him; and yours is a certain hand with the handkerchief."</p>

<p>What words can describe the terror of the devoted wretch? He
could not speak or cry out. Of what use if he had? He knew the
temple was far from men's abodes, and the wind moaned hoarsely in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
the trees above, as the branches swayed to and fro before a brisk
gale now rising with the clouds. He tried to swallow, but in vain.
He sat paralysed, as it were, his eyes wandering vacantly from one
to the other, while his lips were tightened into a ghastly simper of
fear. Neither of the men spoke; but Maun Singh was carelessly
twisting a handkerchief into a peculiar form, and tying a knot at the
end of it. "Thou wilt not feel it, Lallajee," he said jocularly, but
in the strange tongue; "my hand is sure, and I am the best Bhuttote
in Allund."</p>

<p>What the Lalla understood or guessed it was impossible to conceive;
but Fazil felt assured that murder was to be done. "By Alla and
his Prophet!" he said to Bulwunt, "come what may of it, are we
men to stand by tamely and see foul murder committed before our
eyes? Were the wretch a hundred times more liar and coward, one
good blow should be struck against that ruffian. Ho, Pahar Singh!
Maun Singh!" shouted the young Khan before he could be prevented
by his companion. "Hold! would ye do murder?"</p>

<p>"Hur, Hur, Mahadeo!" cried his companion at the same moment,
and both rushed to the place where, on the side they had been
standing, the wall seemed the lowest; but it was still too high to be
reached without a scramble over rough stones, which delayed them
longer than they had thought. The top once gained, they leaped
into the enclosure with drawn weapons; but as they did so, Fazil
saw one man on the top beyond, another climbing up, aided by his
companion. For him and Bulwunt Rao to rush across the court was
the act but of an instant; yet they were too late: the Jogi&mdash;Pahar
Singh&mdash;had escaped, and his companion was in the act of dropping
down, when, aided by a bound, the well-aimed weapon of the young
Khan reached him. Where or how Fazil Khan had wounded the
robber he knew not; but when he examined his bright blade, there
was a broad stain upon it which could not be mistaken. As he looked,
hesitating whether he should leap down and follow, he could just
distinguish two figures dimly, running at desperate speed through
the trees across the plain, which were quickly lost in the gloom.</p>

<p>Bulwunt Rao was at his side. "Another moment and we should
have had both: the gods have protected them; and it is of no use
following, Meah," he said.</p>

<p>"No, no, they are gone," returned Fazil; "it is useless to follow:
better for us to see after that poor wretch yonder&mdash;the villains may
have murdered him, after all;" and they hastened to him.</p>

<p>The flickering blaze was still playing about the little fire, and
served them with enough light to distinguish the objects by it, disclosing,
too, more of the apartment or verandah than they had yet
seen; and as both entered the place at the same moment, a cry of
execration burst simultaneously from them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>"The villains have been too sure! While we scrambled among
those stones they killed him. See, here is an ugly gash, Meah!"
said Bulwunt Rao.</p>

<p>"That would not kill him," said Fazil, stooping to raise up the
body&mdash;"and he is quite warm. I most fear this cloth about his
neck; but look for some water. I would not have him die. So
now&mdash;dash some in his face&mdash;his heart beats, too&mdash;he lives, Bulwunt
Rao!"</p>

<p>"Praise to Narayun! there is at least a chance for him," cried
Bulwunt. "Awake&mdash;arise, O Lalla! and fear not," he continued
to the wounded man; "your enemies are gone, and you are with
friends who can protect you. Here, drink some water. I am a
Hindu who give it; and speak, O man with a small liver!"</p>

<p>These cheering words, accompanied by a few gentle blows on his
back, and a little water forced into his mouth, restored something
like consciousness to the wretch. He opened his eyes and stared
wildly about, and into the faces of those who stood over him: then
he put his hand to his throat as if it hurt him.</p>

<p>"Ay, I dare say," continued Bulwunt&mdash;"I dare say they hurt thee
badly; but fear not, Sree Swâmi has sent you friends; drink, and
it will do you good. Tut, man, you need not be particular about
caste; here is my junwha, and there is no need to ask further.
That's well&mdash;can you speak?"</p>

<p>"Ye are not they," said the Lalla huskily, and in a low tone.
"Friends, how came ye here? Hai, Hai!&mdash;alas, where is my gold?
and where are the robbers who would have killed me? May their
mothers be defiled!"</p>

<p>"Perish the gold, meanhearted," cried Fazil; "with thy soul
hovering betwixt life and death, is thy first thought for thy gold?"</p>

<p>"I worship thy feet, brave Gosai," returned the Lalla; "but it was
all I had, for which I had risked much. Hai, Hai! it is all gone now,
and I am in a strange place without a copper or a friend;" and he
turned to the wall and sobbed bitterly.</p>

<p>"It was a round sum to lose, certainly," said Bulwunt; "but thy
life is safe, and thou hast only to steal again, Lallajee!"</p>

<p>"Better to have died&mdash;better to have died, sirs!" cried the man
distractedly. "When shall I see so much gold again? Look, noble
sirs, is all gone? has he taken all?"</p>

<p>"It was here they counted it," said Fazil; "look about&mdash;a piece or
two may be found; or they may have dropped some in their flight."</p>

<p>Bulwunt blew a dry stick into a blaze, and looked around. He was
fortunate&mdash;a few coins had escaped Pahar Singh, which he gave to
the Lalla, who tied them up in his waist-cloth.</p>

<p>"Look for more&mdash;look yonder, kind sir; and the blessings of a poor
Khayet be on you both," returned the Lalla. "My eyes are dim:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
alas!" he exclaimed, as he put his hand to the back of his neck and
felt blood,&mdash;"I am killed&mdash;I am dying!"</p>

<p>"Peace, fool!" cried Fazil impatiently, "a child would have cut
deeper: it has been a strange escape. Give me your scarf&mdash;I will tie
up the wound."</p>

<p>"And here is some more money for you, too, Lallajee," said Bulwunt,
who had now returned, having picked up several gold pieces
in the line which Pahar Singh had taken across the court. "There
may be more, and if you come to-morrow early, you may find them."</p>

<p>"But now we cannot wait, Lalla," added Fazil; "there is no
further fear of your life. The clouds are gathering fast, and there
will be rain; we will see you safe to a guard-room, and I will have
you cared for in the morning; or you can sleep here if you like."</p>

<p>"Ah, leave me not, gentlemen! I am poor and in great pain," replied
the man. "My clothes and horse are a long way from hence:
how shall I get to them? Take me with you and I shall live, else he
will find me out and kill me&mdash;that Pahar Singh."</p>

<p>Supporting the wounded man between them, the two friends
unfastened the door of the courtyard and passed out. The glare and
noise of the bazar seemed only at a short distance, and knowing that
a strong guard was placed at night near the end nearest the city, they
went to it as directly as they could. A few questions were carelessly
asked as to the cause of the wound, and as vaguely answered. A
traveller found wounded, who had been robbed, was probably cause
enough to account for his condition.</p>

<p>"We cannot delay, Lalla," said Bulwunt, in answer to his cries
that one at least would stay with him. "We have far to go, and the
night is passing fast. The clouds, too, are gathering, and the thunder
is growling in the distance. Hark! there will be a storm. Come,
Meah," he whispered, "we may miss him whom we seek. See that
the man's wounds are dressed, Duffadar," he continued aloud to the
officer of the guard, "and let him sleep here."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII.</a></h2>


<p>As Fazil parted from the wounded man, the scenes of the night, the
horrid truth regarding the treachery of his friend's father, the danger
which threatened both, and indeed the whole family, caused him
many an anxious thought. His worst suspicions had only been too
deeply verified, and even now there arose some struggle between duty
and allegiance to his King, and affection for the Wuzeer's family, for
the sake of his son. Bulwunt had again avoided the principal street,
and they were once more in the open ground beyond the houses.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
Fazil walked on rapidly and silently; but at length, the oppression of
his thoughts found vent in words. "Let him decide," he said aloud,
in allusion to his father; "wisdom abides with him; and in a matter
like this his advice is precious."</p>

<p>"And what think you of all this, Meah?" asked his companion,
for an instant slackening his pace; "what will the noble Khan Sahib
say to it?&mdash;not indeed that he and the Wuzeer are very intimate
friends either. I tell thee, were not my heart turning to that devil
Tannajee Maloosray, I should be lost in wonder at the Wuzeer's folly."</p>

<p>"Even so," said Fazil, sighing; "a man in whom I would have
placed confidence as in my own father&mdash;one who ought to be
honoured and loved for his faith&mdash;is but a poor knave, after all, Bulwunt&mdash;not
better than that miserable Lalla whom we have just left&mdash;a
thing for men to spit upon. Alas for the world's honesty,
brother! A heap of gold, a few empty titles, the smile of a woman,&mdash;and
power&mdash;which does but make its possessor miserable when he
has gained it&mdash;turns right to wrong, justice to oppression, virtue to
vice, honesty to knavery, faith to treachery. We look for it in the
highest, but it flies from us; we seek it in the lowest, and turn from
them but too often in despair. Should not one sigh at depravity like
this, which finds no echo in one's own heart?"</p>

<p>"True, Meah, and may it long be so with you," returned his companion;
"but your experience of life is as yet small, and as it
increases I fear you will search in vain for the purity which your
own heart now pictures. Perhaps it may exist among women. Sree
Swâmi knows, and you may find it there. I have not, Meah; but
in the world abroad, when you have more to do with it, your sensitive
spirit will become blunted by degrees, and, though a serious
matter like this will trouble it, you will gradually learn to pass many
a broad lie or rogue's trick which now vexes you, without notice
beyond a passing curse or a hasty blow. Patience, Meah Sahib! thou
hast much to learn yet; would it were good, and not evil!"</p>

<p>"Ah, would it were, Bulwunt Rao! Your experience is from the
crooked ways and thoughts of your own people, of which men make
proverbs; but for a noble of the state to betray his salt in this base
manner, makes me sick at heart. But this is no time, friend, to think
of aught but the work we have to do; and what more has to come of
the night we know not. Hark! the thunder growls again, and the
storm is coming up fast&mdash;we had as well run on to shelter; and what
more may follow, Alla knows!"</p>

<p>So saying, they hastened as rapidly as the rough ground and
increased darkness would admit, Bulwunt Rao guiding his young
master through narrow lanes and over deserted spaces, till they again
emerged into the now nearly deserted bazar. It was just past midnight,
for the trumpeter at the guard-house, taking up the signal from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
the fort gate, had blown a flourish, which was understood by the
keepers of liquor-shops in the quarter. The booths were still open,
as well as those of confectioners and bhung or opium sellers; but the
lights were being extinguished, and the groups which had been concealed
within turned into the street.</p>

<p>A wild company truly! Some staggering in the last stage of
idiotic drunkenness from opium, others tossing their arms wildly in
the air, while their obscene and fearful curses and imprecations
mingled with the low muttering of the thunder, which hardly ceased,
and seemed to grow nearer every moment. Many forms lay prostrate
in the street&mdash;some sleeping off the fumes of drink, or groaning
in helpless intoxication; and they were often beset by women,
whose loosened hair and disordered garments, and the wild leer of
their glistening eyes, bespoke their depraved condition. But, casting
those who were most importunate violently aside, they at length
gained the temple, which was close to the drinking-shop we have before
mentioned, and paused for a moment near the gate, which was
now shut, while all was silent within.</p>

<p>"Let me look over thee, Meah," said his companion, "as we have
a little light, and are free from those drunken wretches. Dost thou
know, Meah, I have been like them sometimes, I fear; but this sight
sickens and sobers me."</p>

<p>"God grant it, friend, it is the only thing I have ever feared in
you," he replied warmly.</p>

<p>"Yes, it will do," continued Bulwunt; "the disguise is complete.
So&mdash;the chin scarf a little more over the end of the nose: there&mdash;no
one would ever suspect you. Now, I have a plan in my head, which
thou wilt say could only come of a Mahratta's brain&mdash;crooked and
wilful. It is this: I think, from bazar gossip, that Tannajee and
Pahar Singh are one, and that they have met at Tooljapoor at the
temple, or at that old villain Bussunt Geer's, at whose Mutt Tannajee's
people put up, or that they have corresponded with each other
through him. It is not very long since I was there&mdash;about two
months ago, Meah. They were very busy&mdash;so much so that the old
fox would hardly let me stay; but I was certain there was something
going on; and now I have seen Pahar Singh, I am sure he came one
day and held counsel with the old Gosai. Now, if Tannajee has not
been there&mdash;as I will find out, if possible&mdash;I can personate Poorun
Geer, the disciple of Bussunt Geer, and we may find out more of this
plot. But be thou silent&mdash;a vow of silence for a year. I dread thy
courtly speech breaking out even of our rough Mahratta tongue or a
Mussulmani oath. Trust to me, Meah: I will not fail thee if we
meet this fellow!"</p>

<p>"I would we had brought the guard with us, Bulwunt," said Fazil.</p>

<p>"Guard!" said his companion, laughing. "Look, there are his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
sentinels. That fellow," pointing to a figure seated at a little distance
on the ground, muffled in a black blanket, and hardly to be distinguished
from an animal or a stone, "is one. I saw him shift his
position so as to watch us; and I see three others in different directions,
Meah; one will cough, or sneeze, or make some signal when
we move&mdash;and there is old Rama in the doorway, listening. Guard,
Meah! no, no; we may kill Tannajee if we are lucky, but were a
guard to approach, he would be off into the deserted ground at the
back, and who could find him? Now, come; and may the gods
protect us!"</p>

<p>It was but a few steps. As they moved past, a low cough proceeded
from the sitting figure on the watch, and a light streamed from the
doorway as the publican, Rama, moved in.</p>

<p>"Did you see that?" whispered Bulwunt&mdash;"is it not as I told
you? Keep your sword ready, Meah; but be not hasty, whatever
you may see or hear."</p>

<p>So saying, they stepped into the vestibule of the shop&mdash;an open
space, around which were benches of raised earth or brick, neatly
plastered over. A counter with some brass measures and a large
copper vase, brightly polished, containing spirit, stood at one side,
and a lamp burned in a niche.</p>

<p>Bulwunt took one of the brass drinking-cups and rattled it against
another as a signal; for, as he supposed, the owner of the place had
gone to an inside apartment. As he came forth, Bulwunt accosted
him, and requested two hookas to be filled&mdash;one with tobacco, the
other with ganja, and was advancing to the inner apartment when
the man stopped him.</p>

<p>"There are no hookas to be had here to-night; it is past the hour,
Babajee," he said, "and I am out of ganja till to-morrow. Nor can
you go in there, for the place is engaged; and they who are within
will not brook being disturbed."</p>

<p>"Ha! then there is play going on, Rama; and that is what we
came for&mdash;a new hand is always welcome. Go and tell them there are
two <i>gentlemen</i> without who would join."</p>

<p>"Play? No, truly," cried the man&mdash;"they have other work to
do. But go your way, both of ye, for I cannot admit either of you
at this time of night, and have no hookas for you to smoke. Begone;
there are plenty of mudud khanas in the street besides mine, where
you can get all you want. Begone, ere the rain increases."</p>

<p>"Nay, be not inhospitable, good fellow," returned Bulwunt, soothingly;
"and here is a trifle for thee&mdash;even for shelter. Hark to the
thunder!" And as he spoke, another blinding flash of lightning
illumined the interior of the shop, while a crashing peal of thunder
followed hard upon it. "We shall have more of that, Rama; and as
to stirring out in the rain,"&mdash;for it had come plashing down with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
thunder&mdash;"whose dog am I that I should go out in it&mdash;I or my
brother either? Is this a night to turn two votaries of Sree Mahadeo
into the streets&mdash;strangers, too, who know no other place of shelter?
And were we not told to come to Rama's shop near the temple?"
he added to Fazil; who, sitting down, nodded assent, and followed
his example.</p>

<p>"There is a Gosai's Mutt hard by, round the corner," returned the
man doggedly, "and a temple of Bhowani away yonder, in the plain
at the back, among the tamarind trees. You will find your brethren
in one, and shelter and water in the other, if ye need them. Begone,
and trouble me no more. Get up; why sit ye there unbidden?
Get up!"</p>

<p>"Get up and go to a Mutt, indeed!" retorted Bulwunt, who did
not move, but, on the contrary, settled himself more determinedly
and doggedly upon a seat. "Not I&mdash;in this rain! How, brother?"
he added to Fazil, "shall we attempt to enter the Mutt at night
through barred doors?&mdash;be taken for thieves, and be fired upon for
our pains, perhaps?" Fazil shook his head. "No: we were told to
come here to Rama's&mdash;is thy name Rama, friend?&mdash;and here we are."</p>

<p>"Who told ye to come here?" asked the kullal.</p>

<p>"It concerns thee not, good man," replied Bulwunt, "unless they
call you Rama."</p>

<p>"That is my name; and what is your business with me?" he returned
sulkily.</p>

<p>"That you will know by-and-by," replied Bulwunt. "Meanwhile,
as to the Mutt and the temple, who knows whether there is either the
one or the other; and who can go to look in this storm? Wherefore,
worthy sir," he continued to the keeper of the place, "we are
very comfortable, and intend to remain. We are not beasts to be
turned out in rain like this. So, kindly bring the hookas, and when
we have smoked we will rest after our long travel to-day. As to
those here before us, we are not likely to molest them; and if they
do not let us alone, we have weapons, and can defend ourselves.
Therefore, be reasonable." Bulwunt spoke loudly, that he might be
heard by the men within.</p>

<p>"What noise is that?" suddenly asked a strange voice from behind
a partition close to which they were sitting. "Did I not tell
thee, Rama, to admit no one?"</p>

<p>"May I be your sacrifice, Rao Sahib," returned the kullal, joining
his hands together, and advancing to the door of the room, "your
slave desired these two Gosais to depart civilly, but they will not
move; they say they were told to come here, and ask for hookas.
When I told them to be gone, one fellow talked about his weapons,
and I believe they are drunk."</p>

<p>"About weapons, did he, Rama? and who art thou, mad youth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
who venturest here into the privacy of gentlemen?" said a tall
man, who now advanced from behind the partition with a sword in
his left hand, while, observing that Bulwunt Rao and Fazil were
armed, his right hand passed to his sword-hilt, and rested there,
with a determined action.</p>

<p>How the stern tones of his voice thrilled to the heart of Bulwunt
Rao, as he listened to them after an interval of many years. When
he last heard them he was a mere youth. Shrieks of women were
ringing in his ears, and his enemy's fierce commands to kill and
spare none&mdash;hurried shouts, and the clash of steel. As he stood, the
past recurred to Bulwunt Rao so vividly that, though years had
intervened, it seemed only as if that night had gone, and morning
had succeeded. There could be no doubt he was in Maloosray's
presence. The same grave, determined manner&mdash;the same large
black eye&mdash;as the proverb about him said, "Gentle as a fawn's, or
fierce as a tiger's"&mdash;the same deep-toned voice. Time had hardly
tinged his whiskers and moustaches with grey, but his face was
weather-beaten and seared, as it were, by the sun, and his large bony
frame more developed, than when they had last met&mdash;the boy and
the cruel fiery youth. The light from a rude lamp in a niche of the
wall threw a strong glare upon his face, which he did not seek to
evade; while the features of Bulwunt Rao and his companion were
in a great measure concealed by the shadow thrown upon them in the
corner where they sat.</p>

<p>"A poor Gosai," answered Bulwunt in the Mahratta tongue, but
in a tone as haughty as that in which he had been addressed, "who,
with his brother, has sought shelter here and refreshment. Why
shouldst thou interfere?"</p>

<p>"Ha! a proud speech, young sir; and your companion, why does
he not answer?" returned Maloosray.</p>

<p>"He has a vow of silence for a year, made at the shrine of our
Mother of Tooljapoor," returned Bulwunt, doggedly.</p>

<p>"Enough," cried Maloosray, "begone in her name! There is a
temple of hers a gunshot from hence; begone to it."</p>

<p>"We must know who it is that has the power to send us hence ere
we stir foot to depart," retorted Bulwunt, rising, and raising his really
fine figure to its full height; and as Fazil Khan followed his example,
both were ready to meet any sudden assault. "Who dares, I say,
send us out in such rain? Are we men or dogs, to be put out with
insult from a public place in such weather?"</p>

<p>Tannajee's sword was drawn in an instant, and flashed brightly
in the flickering glare of the lamp. The others were as rapidly
unsheathed; but both parties stood on the defensive,&mdash;neither struck.</p>

<p>"For the love of Mahadeo, for the love of Bhowani, by your
fathers' heads! no blood-shedding here, good sirs!" cried the keeper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
of the house imploringly, passing between them, and stretching out
his hands deprecatingly to each in turn. "I shall be ruined! fined!&mdash;they
will hang me! Hold! there will be blood shed. Help!
help!" he shrieked in a frantic manner, seeing Tannajee advance
a step.</p>

<p>Hearing his cries and the altercation, two men rushed from the
inner apartment with drawn weapons, and would have attacked the
others at once, but Tannajee withheld them.</p>

<p>"Peace!" he cried; "put down your weapons, friends. Peace,
bold youth!" he continued to Bulwunt Rao; "you have run a
fearful risk unmoved, which you do not know of. Who are you?"
he asked rapidly.</p>

<p>"A Gosai: I have said it already," replied the other.</p>

<p>"A disciple of what teacher?"</p>

<p>"How are you to know, even if I tell it truly, who my Gooroo
is?" returned Bulwunt. "Is Bussunt Geer of Tooljapoor known
to you?"</p>

<p>"Ha! Bussunt Geer of Tooljapoor? but his cheyla is Poorun
Geer, not thou?"</p>

<p>"Maharaj, it is true; but I am the younger. Poorun Geer stays
with the Gooroo."</p>

<p>"And your name?"</p>

<p>"As-Geer."</p>

<p>"When were you made a cheyla?"</p>

<p>"About a year ago; and I was at Bhaga Nugger and Golconda
till lately; in the house there."</p>

<p>"And what has brought you here?"</p>

<p>"I do not answer questions except upon the Gooroo's business,"
replied Bulwunt haughtily.</p>

<p>"Good, thou art discreet, O Babajee! And thy companion?"</p>

<p>"He is a novitiate under a vow of silence for a year."</p>

<p>"Good. Let there be peace between us for a while, till I prove
thee true or false."</p>

<p>Bulwunt was about to make a passionate reply, when the imploring
look of Fazil met his eye. It seemed to say, Go on with this
deception; and, after a moment's thought, Bulwunt Rao determined
to do so, and to refrain from violence so long as it suited his
purpose. Ready himself to strike if needful, he might be able to
throw Tannajee off his guard.</p>

<p>"Listen," continued Tannajee; "by one question I shall know
if thou art true or false. If true, well for thee, Baba; if false, by
the holy 'Máta!' hadst thou ten men's lives, and ten others to back
thee, thou shouldst die like a dog."</p>

<p>"That is easier to say than to do," returned Bulwunt in a contemptuous
tone. "I have seen enough of bullies at Bhaga Nugger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
to fear big words. But speak; if I can answer your question,
well; if not, what is in my hand may reply to anything further."</p>

<p>Maloosray laughed aloud&mdash;a short bitter laugh, very grating to
hear. "How much ganja hast thou smoked, O Baba?" he asked
with a sneer; "but stay, this is folly. If thou art Poorun Geer's
cheyla, thou knowest Pahar Singh?"</p>

<p>"What Pahar Singh?&mdash;him of Itga?"</p>

<p>"The same: we call him of Allund."</p>

<p>"The Hazaree?"</p>

<p>"Ay&mdash;Hazaree, robber, Gosai, murderer, if thou wilt. If he is
known to thee, why ask? By Khundôba! I distrust this fellow,"
he added to the two others, who closed up to him; "why did he
ask?"</p>

<p>"I know him," said Bulwunt doggedly, "he is here."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"He was in the temple of Bhowani behind there less than half an
hour ago, for I spoke to him."</p>

<p>"Thou? why?"</p>

<p>"I had a message from the Gooroo for him."</p>

<p>"And where is he now?"</p>

<p>"Nay, how should I know? I saw him there with one Maun
Singh, and another, whom I knew not."</p>

<p>"Strange that he should not have come," continued Maloosray,
after a pause. "Art thou sure of the man?"</p>

<p>"As sure as that&mdash;&mdash;" Bulwunt had nearly spoken his adversary's
name, but a twitch from Fazil checked him. "As sure as
that I see thee, O Maharaj."</p>

<p>"And who am I?"</p>

<p>"Nay, I know not, nor care. My message was to Pahar Singh,
and it was delivered. I was told to come here to meet some others;
ye may be they. Pahar Singh may be yet at the temple," observed
Bulwunt, who trusted to his ingenuity to get rid of one of the men.
"Why not send for him?"</p>

<p>"A good thought," said Maloosray; "go at once, Abajee," he
observed to the smaller of the two men. "Here is my blanket&mdash;the
rain will not signify, and take one of the men with you."</p>

<p>"And bring Pahar Singh here, Maharaj?" asked the man,
sheathing his sword, and turning to look for his shoes, which were
near a door they had not observed.</p>

<p>"Yes. Tell him I am here with Bussunt Geer's cheyla, and that
there is no fear. If he be gone, come away; we will await you."</p>

<p>As Maloosray turned slightly to speak the last words, a look of
intelligence passed between Fazil and Bulwunt; but though the
odds against them had been withdrawn, Maloosray's suspicions had
apparently not relaxed in the least, for he stood, his weapon ready<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
for action, and his shield advanced before his body, so that Bulwunt
had as yet no opportunity to strike as he desired. His account of
himself was plausible enough, but it did not apparently satisfy the
wily Mahratta.</p>

<p>"And Pahar Singh was there, Baba?" he asked; "know you for
certain? What message had you to him?"</p>

<p>"Nay, it was easy enough, Maharaj," returned Bulwunt; "all he
told me was, to meet Pahar Singh at the temple of Bhowani, near
the kullal's quarter, this night, and afterwards to come to Rama's
shop near the temple, where I should find some Mahrattas who
would give me a message. I have reached Beejapoor in four days,
and must return to-morrow. If you are the person I was to meet
here, tell me what I am to say, and I will go; for we need a
lodging for the night, and our horses are in the city."</p>

<p>"Where?" asked Maloosray.</p>

<p>"At the Taj Bowree;<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> but I shall be away by early dawn."</p>

<p>"But the fort gate will be shut, Baba."</p>

<p>"I have a friend at the wicket who will let us in. Do not fear
for that, Maharaj!" replied Bulwunt confidently.</p>

<p>Maloosray thought for a moment. "It must be true," he added.
"Now, Baba, listen; if I trust thee, couldst thou help the cause
Bussunt Geer has at heart?"</p>

<p>"I will be faithful to him; is he not my Gooroo?"</p>

<p>"And thy companion?"</p>

<p>"Surely, as myself. We are one."</p>

<p>"Then listen," said Maloosray, for once thrown off his guard,
and now leaning upon his sword. "I believe this tale could not
have been invented, for no one knows, but the Gooroo, why Pahar
Singh would venture to Beejapoor, and what need he had to bring
me here. I do not care to see Pahar Singh, who is a stupid ruffian;
but if thou wilt deliver my message to Bussunt Geer in four days,
it may save trouble to many people, and help what we have in
hand. Tell him if he can get the Lalla's papers, to keep them; if
Pahar Singh has them, to make him keep them till Khan Mahomed
can redeem them. They will be worth thousands&mdash;lakhs, perhaps, if
they are what I think. Tell the Gooroo that Sivaji Bhóslay will
not be unmindful of his care in this matter; say also that Pahar
Singh has disappointed me, and it is better the message went
through thee; for who can trust one who has a double face, and
who is with the King to-day, Sivaji the next, Alumgeer the day
after&mdash;fickle and covetous, looking only after gold. Yet, if he
please to meet me, he knows the place and the time. Hast thou
comprehended all this?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>
<p>"Fully; but thy name? Thou mayst be an impostor. Whom
shall I tell him I met at this place, and whose message am I to
believe?"</p>

<p>"He did not tell thee? He was afraid, perhaps, my name should
be heard in Beejapoor; but I laugh at such precautions. Say that
the servant of Sivaji Bhóslay&mdash;one Tannajee Maloosray&mdash;bids thee
say what I have told thee."</p>

<p>"Tannajee&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ay! Tannajee Maloosray. If thou art from Poona thou mayst
chance to have heard of it."</p>

<p>"Maloosray of Rohéla?"</p>

<p>"The same; there is no other Tannajee Maloosray living&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And I, villain and murderer! am Bulwunt Rao of Sewnee," he
shouted, no longer able to control himself, and assaulting his hereditary
enemy with all his force. "Upon them, Meah, in the name
of the King! Hur, hur! Mahadeo!"</p>

<p>It was well for Maloosray that the point of Bulwunt's sword
caught a projecting rafter of the low roof as it descended, else he
had never spoken more. Nevertheless it reached him; and though
a steel chain had been woven into his turban, which prevented a
severe wound, the force of the blow somewhat stunned him; and so
fierce and unexpected was the assault, that for an instant his
habitual presence of mind failed him. But for an instant only.
Ere Bulwunt could repeat the blow, Maloosray had leaped aside,
and began to press his impetuous adversary very closely. Fazil, in
his turn, had attacked the companion of Maloosray, and found him
a wary swordsman; and the place, confined as it was, afforded no
room for rapid movement; while the light was dim and treacherous.
Blows were, however, rapidly exchanged. The quarrel could not
continue long: for the shouts and cries of the keeper of the house,
and of several of Maloosray's scouts, who were unarmed, aroused
the guard, who rushed to the spot with loud exclamations and
drawn weapons.</p>

<p>Tannajee felt in an instant that he had no chance if they entered,
and he knew that if taken his execution would be immediate and
certain. Just, therefore, as the dark figure of the foremost of the
guard was entering the shop behind Bulwunt, and by whose rapid
tread and shouts he was somewhat thrown off his guard, Tannajee
gathered himself up for a desperate blow, and delivered it with an
abusive imprecation. "Once I failed," he said&mdash;"not now!" As
he spoke, the heavy weapon descended with all his great strength;
Bulwunt tried to stop it, but it caught the edge, not the face of the
shield, and, though he partially succeeded, or he had never breathed
more, glancing from the hard and polished edge of the shield, it
lighted upon Bulwunt's bare neck and shoulder, cutting down to
the bone in a ghastly manner.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>Maloosray saw with exultation that the blood poured forth in a
torrent, and, as Bulwunt staggered and fell back, he called to his
companion to follow him, and both darted through the back apartments
into a court leading into a narrow street beyond, and as they
passed they closed both the doors behind them.</p>

<p>"Follow me!&mdash;a thousand rupees for Tannajee Maloosray's
head!" cried Fazil to the guard; and though they pursued him for
a short distance, all chance of capturing him was hopeless in that
murky darkness and heavy rain.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV.</a></h2>


<p>It was no fear of Maloosray or lack of enterprise that caused the
young Khan to desist from his pursuit; but finding that his retainer
had not followed him, nor, indeed, any of the guard&mdash;the fear that
Bulwunt might have been wounded occurred to him, or that he had
been apprehended and detained. It was hopeless also to trace
Maloosray, or to ascertain which way he and his companion had
proceeded, as they issued from the door of the courtyard into the
lane behind. Turning back then, after he had run a few paces, by
the way he had come, and directed by the clamour inside the house,
he passed rapidly through the yard, and entered the room where the
quarrel had taken place; this he found filled with armed men, with
several torch-bearers standing around what appeared to be the dead
body of his friend.</p>

<p>Fazil had observed Maloosray's violent attack upon him, and that
Bulwunt retreated a step or two to avoid it; while at the same time
he had advanced towards his own antagonist. The consequences of
that blow, therefore, were not immediately seen by him. Now inexpressibly
shocked and grieved by the result, Fazil heeded no one;
but pressing his way through those assembled, somewhat roughly,
he threw himself on his knees beside Bulwunt, who was quite insensible,
and, laying aside his sword, strove to raise him up. He
saw indeed with great grief that Bulwunt had received a very severe
wound; and the pool of blood flowing from the cut, which had not
been stanched, and his apparently lifeless condition, caused the most
lively alarm.</p>

<p>"Will no one help me?" cried Fazil, looking round, while vainly
endeavouring to stanch the blood which occasionally welled from the
gaping wound, as Bulwunt breathed heavily. "For the love of God
and the Apostle lend me thy waist-band, good sir!" he continued,
addressing a respectable-looking man who had accompanied the
soldiers, and who was, in fact, the petty officer over them; "or bid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
some one loose my waist-cloth, else he will perish. Alas, my true
friend and brother!"</p>

<p>"And who are you," returned the man contemptuously, "who, in
the dress of a Kafir Gosai, dares to take the name of the holy Apostle?&mdash;on
whom be peace!&mdash;a thief or murderer, I warrant. How say
you, brother! He may have done this himself, and now mingles
with us to pretend grief and avoid suspicion. Here is some evil,
depend upon it; seize him and bind him fast."</p>

<p>"Yes, my lords," cried the keeper of the house, who now ventured
forward, "bind him fast. That is the fellow who did the murder.
They quarrelled over their ganja; and though I did all I could to
prevent them&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Peace!" cried Fazil, accustomed only to command, and who could
ill brook the measures threatened; for several men had closed about
him at their officer's order, while another had kicked away his sword,
which one of the men was picking up. "Peace, I say; raise him
up! See, he is badly wounded; have you no compassion? He will
die!"</p>

<p>"Whether he dies or whether he lives, one would think it was
little concern of thine, boy," replied the man; "and there is blood
on his sword, too," he added, as the man who had possessed himself
of it held it up to the light. "Seize him, brother, and bind
him fast; he will have to answer for this in the morning. Who art
thou, ill-born?"</p>

<p>As the leader of the party spoke, several of the soldiers had thrown
themselves upon Fazil, who still kneeled beside Bulwunt, and, holding
him down, pulled the turban rudely from his head, and in an
instant bound his arms with it so tightly behind his back that the
act caused him immediate and exquisite pain.</p>

<p>"Who art thou, knave?" asked the man again peremptorily.</p>

<p>"Speak," cried several of the men, shaking him rudely; "don't
you hear what his worship says to you? Speak!"</p>

<p>"It is useless for me now to say who I am," replied Fazil looking
round. "Enough that I am one of your own faith, as ye will know
when the morning breaks;&mdash;one who may be able to punish you for
rough uncivil usage, or reward you if that poor fellow is speedily
aided. I care little what happens to myself; but if ye know of a
physician near, or a skilful barber, I pray, good sir," he continued,
addressing himself to the officer, "send for him, that a valuable life
may be saved."</p>

<p>This speech was received with a shout of derision by most of the
party; but their leader was not unobservant, and he saw at once, by
the manner and speech of Fazil, that he was no common person;
certainly not, what his attire proclaimed him to be, a Gosai. There
was a chance that he might be some one of rank in disguise. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
keeper of the house had declared him to be the man who had struck
down the unfortunate Bulwunt; but, again, the consideration of his
return to the spot, and his sincere grief at the poor fellow's wound,
went far to assure the officer that his prisoner had not done the deed,
and that whoever did it had escaped. These thoughts rapidly occurring,
caused the Duffadar to doubt whether rigour was needful.
"Art thou a Gosai?" he asked again. "Answer truly!"</p>

<p>"There is no God but God, and Mahomed is the Prophet of God,"
exclaimed Fazil, repeating the creed, and, as rapidly as possible, in
Arabic, the first part of the midnight prayer. "No, good sir, I am
no Gosai, but a humble disciple of the Prophet, on whom be peace!"</p>

<p>"Toba, Toba! now shame on me that I should have put a Mussulman
to disgrace," exclaimed the Duffadar. "Loose him, friends&mdash;we
will see to this; and run one of ye to the respectable Meer
Hoosein, who lives in the alley yonder, and is a skilful doctor; and,
if I mistake not, there is a clever barber, one Nunda, who lives near
him, and who is accustomed to matters of this kind. Bid him bring
his needles to sew up the wound. And, hark ye, no excuses from
either about the rain and lateness of the night; this is the King's
business, and a matter of life and death."</p>

<p>Then turning to Bulwunt, who had been raised up while Fazil's
arms were being unbound, and who appeared sensible, he spoke
cheerfully to him, bidding him not to be afraid, for he would be well
treated.</p>

<p>"Water!" gasped the poor fellow, looking dreamily about him
and pointing to his mouth&mdash;"Water!"</p>

<p>"Here is a vessel full," cried a bearded soldier, advancing; "drink,
friend."</p>

<p>"Hold," said Fazil, "he is a Hindu; he will not take it from
you. Where is the kullal? Let him get some."</p>

<p>"Here, great sir," said the man, advancing with a brass vessel
full. "Who is he? May he take water from me?"</p>

<p>"He is a Mahratta," replied Fazil.</p>

<p>"Then there is no fear," added the kullal, and he knelt down
and poured a little into Bulwunt's mouth, who drank it eagerly,
and, laying hold of the vessel itself, took a long draught, which
seemed to revive him; while the kullal, untying the scarf about
his chin, wetted it with water and applied it to the wound; and,
removing his turban, also wetted his head.</p>

<p>This treatment soon revived Bulwunt, who now sat up and
passed his hand dreamily over his eyes, but did not speak.</p>

<p>"He seems recovering," said the Duffadar to Fazil, who had been
pulled to one side and was held by two men, though his arms were
untied. "So far thou art fortunate, young sir; but, in the name
of the saints, why didst thou strike him down? Was this well?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
'Twas but yesterday that the Kótwal swore on the Kôrán that he
would have the right arm of the first brawler who should do
murder: pity such fate should befall thee, young as thou art! Are
there not enough of the Shah's enemies abroad to try thy weapons
upon, without mixing in midnight brawls? But speak to thy
friend, if friend he is. It may have been a hasty blow, deeply
regretted."</p>

<p>"Sir, you are under some extraordinary mistake," said Fazil,
who had several times tried to interrupt the speaker. "I am not
the man who did this. Ho! Bulwunt, Bulwunt!" he continued,
"speak if you can, and fear not. I am here, and these are friends."</p>

<p>"Meah," said the poor fellow very faintly, "I am badly hurt. I
may die, Ai Narayun! Ai Bhugwân!&mdash;Water, Meah! I am faint
and sick,"&mdash;and he fell back almost insensible.</p>

<p>"Loose my arms, good sir," cried Fazil impatiently; "I am no
thief to run away. If there be a Hindu among you, give him some
water. I may not do so."</p>

<p>"Let him go," said the Duffadar to the men, "there is some
mistake here, I think, and no enmity between them; and do thou,
Jewun Singh, fetch a vessel of water&mdash;he will drink from thy hand
freely."</p>

<p>Fazil's first act on being released was to examine the wound,
which was severe, and required care. The sabre of Maloosray had
cut deep into the neck, close to the shoulder, and the loss of blood
had been very great. A little higher up and the wound must have
been instantly fatal. To wring out the scarf which the kullal had
placed upon it, and replace it wetted, was Fazil's first care, and in
this the Duffadar and some of the men now lent a willing hand.
Fresh cool water was also brought by the man who had been sent
for it, and Bulwunt Rao, having again drunk freely, sat up supported
by his young lord.</p>

<p>"Ask him now, Duffadar Sahib," said Fazil, "whether it was I
who wounded him, and, on his reply, give me liberty or not as
seems good to you. Speak, Bulwunt Rao, did I hurt you?"</p>

<p>"Now may his tongue rot who says so," replied the wounded man,
looking wildly about him. "But thou art safe, Meah!&mdash;and did
they escape?"</p>

<p>"Who?" asked the Duffadar sharply.</p>

<p>"Tannajee Maloosray, the friend of Sivaji Bhóslay," returned
Bulwunt. "People know of him, perhaps!"</p>

<p>"Tannajee Maloosray? Thou art dreaming, friend," said the
Duffadar, with an incredulous smile. "Tannajee dared no more
enter Beejapoor than&mdash;than&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Than you, good sir, dare go to him, I suppose," said Fazil,
ending the sentence. "Nevertheless, he was here, and but for a
mischance would have been lying dead there."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>"Tannajee here!" mused the Duffadar; "this must, then, be
some deep plot, and the city is full of plots. Sir," he said to the
young Khan, "the mention of that name, and all the events we
have seen, cause many suspicions in my mind which I am not competent
to dispose of; therefore, whoever thou art, release is impossible
till the morning, when I must give an account of all matters
to the Kótwal, who has cautioned the guards to be watchful against
Mahratta parties and Moghul emissaries."</p>

<p>"Willingly," replied Fazil. "I could not leave him now, nor
till his wound is dressed. As for myself, I am Fazil, the son of
Afzool Khan, though I may not tell why I am disguised as an
infidel, and why found in this place; suffice it to say it was in the
King's service."</p>

<p>"Now may I receive my lord's pardon," cried the old man, presenting
humbly the hilt of his sword as an offering. "Why did he
not tell me sooner, and this offence and presumption would have been
spared? Who among us does not know the valiant Afzool Khan,
and have not all heard of his son Fazil Khan, the pillar of the
state?" he added to the men, who fell back, saluting the young man
with mingled curiosity and respect.</p>

<p>"Give me some water," said Fazil. "This dress and appearance
are against me, Duffadar," he continued, laughing; "and if I had
told who I was when ye seized me first, my arms might even have
been bound a screw tighter perhaps. It does not signify now, for
you only did your duty, as I can bear witness. Ah, the water is
come&mdash;pour it over my hands, good fellow, and after the paint has
disappeared, some of ye may know me."</p>

<p>"I know you, my lord," said a youth who pressed forward, as
Fazil turned again to the light from the door where he had been
washing his face. "Yes, father," he continued to the Duffadar, "this
is truly the brave young Khan&mdash;no doubt of that;" and he stepped
forward and touched Fazil's feet.</p>

<p>"Too dangerous, too dangerous," said the Duffadar, "for one
like him. Yes, thou art right, Ashruf&mdash;now I know the face too;
but the disguise was perfect; who could have guessed it? Too
dangerous: and thou the only son of the noble Khan! Ah, sir,
had any evil befallen thee&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No matter if I had died," cried Fazil, "it would have been in the
Shah's service; but here are the physician and barber, and my
friend's wound must be dressed; and do one of ye see for that
kullal, who knows more of Tannajee than any one else. Where
is he?"</p>

<p>While some of the men went to search for the kullal, the barber,
having trimmed the lamp and increased the light by several wicks,
unfastened a leathern case containing razors and other instruments,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
and selecting two crooked needles fitted with waxed silk thread, put
them aside, while he washed the wound clean in a careful and confident
manner. A few stitches brought the lips of the cut together,
after which it was bound up with fresh leaves of the neem tree,
which cooled the wound and refreshed the patient.</p>

<p>All this having been effected, Bulwunt Rao was carefully raised
up and borne by several of the men to the chowree, or guard-room,
which was hard by, but at the opposite side of the quarter to that
in which the Lalla had been lodged.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV.</a></h2>


<p>While search was being made for the kullal, Fazil's thoughts
reverted painfully to his father and sister. He could not leave
Bulwunt without exposing himself to further suspicion; but he
might at least send news of his safety, and his application to the
Duffadar for a messenger was promptly acceded to.</p>

<p>"Surely, Khan," was the prompt reply, "I could hardly refuse
your going yourself, if you asked; but it is better you stayed.
Men's tongues are bad, and I am only a humble man. Verily I will
send my own son Ashruf, and he will do the errand carefully. He
is gone&mdash;that is, my son Ashruf&mdash;my lord, to see the barber home,
and will be here directly. A brave youth, O Khan, and with a
large heart. Does my lord remember the Friday's fight with the
Moghuls in the plain by Allapoor? Well, in that my boy did good
service, and in killing one of the enemy got a sharp cut himself
over the arm, but he did not care for it; and was he not fighting on
the strength of the King's salt?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, I remember it well, Duffadar," returned Fazil, "for I
was beaten down, and wellnigh killed myself, when this poor friend
of mine here rescued me. How, Bulwunt! was it not that day?"</p>

<p>"Ay, Meah, that very day," he said faintly; "the last battle
Bulwunt Rao will ever see in thy service. I am very faint, Meah.
These films before my eyes seem to precede death. I pray thee
leave me not here."</p>

<p>"Nay, fear not," replied Fazil; "the barber said there was no
danger of life. Be of good heart, Bulwunt&mdash;no bones are cut;
and though there is much weakness from loss of blood, you will
soon be well. Get to sleep, we shall not leave before daylight."</p>

<p>"I do not fear, Meah. Death has no pain or regret for me. My
only wish was to die in the service of your house. I am the last of
my race, and have no one to mourn for me like thee, Meah! I
would live for thee if it be the will of God; and but for this, death
would be welcome."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>"Peace! do not speak, friend," returned Fazil; "go to sleep, and
thou wilt be strong ere morning. Does not the barber, I tell thee,
say there is no danger? so be comforted."</p>

<p>"None perhaps of life, Meah; but this arm, which was all I had
to live for, it will never hold sword more, Meah&mdash;never, never!"
and he sobbed like a child.</p>

<p>"Fear not," cried the Duffadar cheerily; "I have worse wounds
on me than that, Rao Sahib, and yet my arm can strike a blow for
the Shah; so be comforted, and get to sleep."</p>

<p>Bulwunt sighed. "If I had only slain him," he said, "and
revenged the dead, then I could have died; or if this arm had gone
for that, its best service in life would have been done. I shall never
have such a chance again, Meah. But the gods have need of him,
and he has the protection of Dévi. He and Sivaji Bhóslay both
have it, as ye will see hereafter, Meah. Who can resist them?"</p>

<p>"This is the youth of whom I spake, Khan Sahib," said the
Duffadar; "a brave boy&mdash;a brave boy he always was."</p>

<p>And truly there was much in the appearance of the youth to corroborate
this. An open, dare-devil, good-humoured countenance,
with bright merry eyes, which, as he spoke, seemed to close up till
two bright sparks only were visible; and a wide bow-shaped mouth,
about which fun, and perhaps some mischief, played in perpetual
smiles, conveyed an impression of recklessness of danger, as a lithe
rapidity of movement did of extreme activity of body, and perhaps
endurance.</p>

<p>"A brave youth, doubtless, Duffadar Sahib," said Fazil; "his eye
speaks for him; a boy to be proud of. How sayst thou, lad? Wilt
thou do an errand for the son of Afzool Khan?"</p>

<p>"Ay will I," replied the boy promptly, while he presented his
sword-hilt to the young Khan, as his father had done; "and gladly
too; and if my lord will pardon me for saying it, I have long known
him. Who does not know the brave son of a brave father? Ah,
Meah Sahib! if I had only been on a horse when Afzool Khan's
Paigah dashed into the Moghul's that Friday, I would have struck a
blow with you. I watched you as you rode by close to the standard-bearer.
Then there was a fierce fight, and men said you were cut
down. Ah! I was only on foot, for we are too poor to ride; and
I was&mdash;a little wounded," he added, dropping his eyes modestly,
"and father led me away. But for that, Meah Sahib, I would have
been with you, even on foot."</p>

<p>"Boldly spoken, and with a true heart, Ashruf!" exclaimed
Fazil; "and if you do this errand carefully and quickly for me, you
shall ride ever after with me in my troop&mdash;that is, if your father
will permit it. Afzool Khan's stables have enough horses to find
one for you. Of that, however, more hereafter. Go now to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
house, ask for Goolab the nurse; tell her I am safe, but that
Bulwunt Rao is wounded badly, and a palankeen must be sent
for him with all speed, and my clothes and shawls put into it.
If my father be asleep, he is not to be awakened, but my sister
must know that I am safe. Now begone; here is my ring,
which will pass you through the fort. Let us see how soon you
will return."</p>

<p>"Come, Shékh Hoosein," said the lad, addressing a young man
standing near; "we had better be two. Tie up thy waist-band
tight, for we shall not draw breath till we reach the city gate.
Come!"</p>

<p>Both loosened their waist-scarfs, and retied them tighter, and after
a few words of caution from the Duffadar, they dashed down the
street at full speed.</p>

<p>As they left, several of the men came in, leading the kullal by the
end of his turban, with which his arms were tightly tied down.
Bareheaded, covered with mud, and bleeding slightly from his nose,
his face wearing an expression of fright and pain combined, Rama
was a very different-looking person to what he had appeared when
Fazil Khan and Bulwunt entered his shop. His first impulse was to
cast himself on the ground before Fazil, and lie at full length moaning.
The men who were with him did not interfere. The act was
a deprecation of anger which it would have been unmannerly to
deny.</p>

<p>"Get up," cried Fazil; "get up, knave and liar! Say, was it I
who wounded that poor fellow yonder?"</p>

<p>"Pardon! pardon! Noble Meah, pardon! Your slave will not
rise till he has pardon," cried the man abjectly. "It was all a
mistake; and how could I know the son of Afzool Khan? Pardon!
and I will tell all I know."</p>

<p>"If thou dost not, hound! thou wilt hang upon the highest branch
of the Goruk Imlee to feed the crows before morn," replied Fazil.
"Get up! If thou tellest the truth, I give thee kowl; if not&mdash;if I
detect one word of lie, nothing can save thee. Dost thou hear?
Rise!"</p>

<p>"Get up, Kafir!" cried the man who held the turban, giving it a
jerk, which caused a corresponding exclamation of pain, "Don't
you hear what my lord says to you? He will give you pardon if
you speak the truth. Get up, and tell him all. My lord," he continued
to Fazil, "he knows much, and he has some papers which one
of the fellows&mdash;Maloosray, he says&mdash;dropped as he left the house.
We wanted them, but he said you would pardon him if he gave them
himself. We found him hiding in the wood stack near his still, and
the fool must needs struggle and try to wrestle with one of our men,
and so got a fall; but he is not hurt."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>"Loose my arms, noble Meah&mdash;tell them to loose my arms. They
are swelling already, and I am sick with pain," said the kullal,
rising.</p>

<p>"If my lord allows me, I will loose him. There!" continued the
soldier, on receiving Fazil's sign in the affirmative; "see thou speak
the truth, else I will tie them tighter than ever, and they will not
be loosened again while thou art alive."</p>

<p>"My lord, don't threaten me, or I shall lose my senses," said the
kullal, the horrible vision of hanging, as he had seen many hang to
the branches of that famous tree, coming vividly to his mind. "If
there be a good Hindu among you, give me a drink of water. Ah,
my arms! my arms!" he cried, sitting down again, and sobbing as
the rope was loosened.</p>

<p>"Here is water," said one of the men, advancing with a brass
vessel full. "I am a Rajpoot&mdash;drink."</p>

<p>The draught refreshed him, and he began his tale. It was in the
main correct, and as we have already related it. "Tannajee and his
companions had been at his shop only a few minutes before Fazil
and Bulwunt came in. They had been very careful, and before they
entered the house placed scouts to watch all the approaches. They
spoke in low tones, and, beyond a few words now and then, he had
caught nothing of their conversation. All that he could gather was,
that Pahar Singh and a Gosai from Tooljapoor were expected, and
they were so impatient for their arrival, that two of the men had by
turns gone to see after them."</p>

<p>"Had they ever been at your shop before?" asked Fazil.</p>

<p>"Yesterday one of the men was there twice to say the place would
be wanted in the evening," replied the kullal; "and he gave me ten
rupees to say I had neither spirits nor ganja; so I told every one
I had none, and no one stayed but you."</p>

<p>"You might have suspected they were after no good," said the
Duffadar. "Why did you not give warning here?"</p>

<p>"Ah, sir, I am a poor fellow," returned the man, "with a large
family; and if gentlemen sometimes like a private room to smoke,
to play, or to talk in, am I to forbid them? Would they not get it
elsewhere?"</p>

<p>"True enough&mdash;thou art not to blame," said Fazil; "but the
papers&mdash;what of them?"</p>

<p>"After you were taken away, my lord," replied the kullal, "I
took the lamp inside towards the door, for I thought I saw blood on
the ground, which indeed there was; and one of the two men who
escaped must have been wounded. I followed the trace of blood to
the door of the yard, and there I found this little bag, noble sir;
here it is."</p>

<p>As he spoke he produced a small silken bag, apparently filled with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
papers, from under his waist-cloth, and handed it to Fazil. In it were
several letters, and bundles of accounts written in the Mahratta
character.</p>

<p>"I cannot read these, and they may be of importance; so we must
wait, for this poor fellow of mine is asleep," said Fazil.</p>

<p>"No, Meah, I was dozing while you spoke, and am easier now, for
the bandage has cooled my wound. Papers? What papers?" said
Bulwunt, rising slightly, and supporting himself on his left arm.
"Give them to me."</p>

<p>"There are some in Mahratta, which Tannajee, or one of his companions,
dropped in their flight. Can you make out what they are,
Bulwunt?" asked Fazil.</p>

<p>"I will try, Meah; put the light here. Stay; open them separately.
I forget that I have but one arm now."</p>

<p>The papers were given to him one by one, and his eye glanced
over several in succession as if of no importance; but one appeared to
interest him greatly, and Fazil observed his eyes return, to the commencement
after having looked over it hastily, and his lips to move
as if reading it word by word, while the expression of his face
changed to one of intense concern.</p>

<p>"Yes, Meah, this is indeed important," he said; "but no one
must hear it but thyself or thy father. Listen," he continued,
whispering; "that is from the old Gosai at Tooljapoor, about those
letters the King has obtained. Those whom they concern are mentioned
in feigned names, and it will puzzle me not a little to understand
their meaning fully; but we have a clue in what occurred at
the temple, and I will unravel it when we get home. Now my eyes
are too weary. Stay, there may be something from Sivaji.... No,"
he continued, after he had looked at them one by one, "there are
none from him, but several from Yessjee, who is his friend. No, they
are too wary to write letters; but no doubt there is much intrigue
afoot, Meah&mdash;much."</p>

<p>"Enough," replied Fazil; "now go to sleep, Bulwunt, till daylight
brings people from the house. I too will rest, if I can, after all this
excitement, with your permission, Duffadar Sahib&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But the old man had lain down on the floor while the papers were
being examined, and was fast asleep; so also were the men of the
guard, except one sitting at the doorway as sentinel, the gurgle of
whose hooka mingled with an occasional snore from a sleeper on the
floor. Those about the kullal, who had been removed to a little
distance, asked how he was to be disposed of.</p>

<p>"Take him to his house," said Fazil, "and keep him there till he
is wanted. Go with them, Rama," he continued to the man, "and
be ready when I send for thee. I will answer to the Kótwal for the
night's events."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>"That is all I wanted," he replied. "My lord is very kind and
merciful."</p>

<p>"Not yet. I have much to ask and much to hear. If thou canst
speak the truth, well for thee; if not, beware!"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI.</a></h2>


<p>How slowly and wearily night passes when a sense of impending
evil overpowers sleep, and renders every faculty sharply sensible
to sounds and impressions otherwise of ordinary occurrence,&mdash;when
a thousand vague phantasies flit before the imagination hardly more
definite than the keenly-painful thoughts they awaken! How difficult
thus to endure delay or uncertainty, and to account for causes
of either, so as to gain consolation or assurance to one's self, far less
to impart comfort to others whose fears and apprehensions are perhaps
greater than our own.</p>

<p>Thus heavily was hour after hour counted by Afzool Khan and
his fair daughter in the apartment we have already described. The
Khan busied himself, or seemed to do so, with a pile of Persian
papers, on some of which, from time to time, he made notes: but it
was easy for his daughter to see that his eye often followed vacantly
the lines of the writing, and that his thoughts wandered far from
the subjects before him.</p>

<p>The Khan's wife, Lurlee, had come, and been dismissed with an
injunction not to interrupt him, and that he should be late. Zyna
did not disturb her father, and found a partial occupation in some
embroidery, which helped to dispel for a time her fears for her
brother; gradually, however, as the night wore on, it was easy for
her to see that her father's anxiety increased. It was true that
Fazil's return was not expected till after midnight; but that, under
the thought of his perilous errand, brought no consolation with it,
and she sat watching the expression of her father's countenance,
yet not so as to be observed, and withdrawing her eyes when he
looked up. A few careless words fell from time to time from both,
and a few entreaties by the Khan to his daughter that she would
take rest, were met by requests that she might be allowed to share
his watch, for that she had promised her brother to await his return.</p>

<p>Thus midnight came, and with it sleep to the young girl, that
would not be denied. She had folded her scarf about her person,
and lay down where she was; and her father now watched his
sleeping child, almost wondering at her beauty, as the light fell upon
her, and projected a shadow from the long eyelashes upon her soft
downy cheek. So, with the image of the dead before him&mdash;for he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
remembered her mother even such an one as her child&mdash;Afzool
Khan's thoughts wandered far back into the past,&mdash;far back to the
time when, with life before him and easy competence, the servant of
a noble and united kingdom, the future had not concerned him,
save only to wish that the happiness he possessed might endure.</p>

<p>But that bright future was long past. The present was dark,
uncertain, menacing. Had there been any one to listen, the bitter
sob of the old Khan&mdash;a sob of exquisite pain as his thoughts alternated
between the happy past and a gloomy future&mdash;might have
been heard,&mdash;such pain as those alone can know whose affections
and memories of the past arise most vividly to augment any new
suffering that may be present. The years of happiness in his
home, which might have been his lot had his wife been spared to
him, rose to the mind of Afzool Khan as a sad mockery; for though
the grave had long held her whose fair form seemed renewed before
him, it appeared almost as if she were again present to him in all
her beauty.</p>

<p>"Thou art a fair blossom. May God love thee! May the holy
saints keep thee! May thy mother watch thee, my child!" murmured
the Khan, as he bent over his sleeping daughter. "Even
such was thy mother in those first days, as guileless and as beautiful.
Nay, thou art but the copy, Zyna. And had she but lived to see
thee and thy brother as ye are it would have been well. Yet why
not well as it is?" he resumed after a pause; "surely Fate is good
whatever it be. If my heart warns me of coming ill&mdash;nay, if he too
be gone from me, well; he is with her, and the old man will soon
follow, and there will be peace, peace, peace! Yet I would live
still a little for thee, my child&mdash;only for thee! else the first shot or
keen sword-cut were welcome to Afzool Khan."</p>

<p>So he thought and watched, and at times gently fanned his child
with the papers in his hand that her sleep might be the lighter, and
again resumed his occupation of reading. All was silent, but the
night wind sighed mournfully through the open trelliswork of the
window, and seemed rising; and as he listened, there were mutterings
of a coming storm.</p>

<p>Opening one of the small casements, he looked out. The city
was dark beneath him, and still; even the dogs seemed to have
gone to sleep. Far distant, the wailing howls of a pack of jackals
came upon his ear fitfully, and again ceased as the sound was blown
away by the wind. Over the face of the sky the wild dark clouds
were now hurrying ragidly along, disclosing here and there a star,
which was again as instantly hidden. In the west, the horizon was
black and threatening, and the edges of a heavy bank of cloud, now
fast rising, pile over pile, were illumined like burnished silver, as
lightning flashed rapidly through them, lighting up the city, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
the bold domes and tall minarets of the mosques and mausoleums,
with a sickly glare for an instant, to disappear as rapidly as a
thought. One of the night-storms of the season was evidently
approaching, and the cool fresh wind was grateful to the Khan, as
he leaned forth and looked into the void of darkness abstractedly.</p>

<p>The papers he had been perusing had been the subject of consultation
that day at the court between the King, his Secretary, and
himself. They were reports from the governors of the west and
north-west provinces&mdash;a country which Afzool Khan had governed
some years before, and knew perfectly&mdash;and related to a growing
disaffection and a rising spirit among the people of the mountain
valleys, which could not be accounted for save by the intrigues and
machinations of Sivaji Bhóslay and his adherents. Sivaji, as a
restless youth, had before risen in petty insurrection, and had
resisted small forces sent against him, but had renewed his fidelity
to the State, and had been pardoned. Notwithstanding, however,
he was believed to be active in evil designs; and report assigned to
him constant communication and intrigue with the Moghul emperor
Aurungzeeb, as well as endeavours, on his own account, to excite
the people.</p>

<p>Afzool Khan was no indifferent spectator of these events. He
was one of those who, with others of his rank, had received profuse
promises from the Emperor during his first invasion of the kingdom;
and though Aurungzeeb's intentions had not been finally
declared, yet Afzool Khan knew that if he favoured his cause, even
secretly, for the present, he was certain hereafter, should the
Emperor prevail, of high rank and rewards far beyond those which
he now possessed, and also that the weight and influence of a few
men like himself would at once turn the scale against Beejapoor,
which already trembled in the balance.</p>

<p>The Moghul party, he well knew, was strong in the city. Many
who had been disappointed of court influence almost openly professed
it: they had nothing to lose and everything to hope for.
But there were others&mdash;like the prime-minister, Khan Mahomed,
for instance&mdash;who, in the enjoyment of large estates, high commands,
and immense wealth, still desired more; nay, even the
partition of the kingdom, that they might hold what they possessed
as independent princes.</p>

<p>Again, Aurungzeeb's zeal for the cause of his faith was a well-known
element of his character. He was a strict Soonnee, who held
the heretical belief of the Sheeas in hereditary hatred; and the
sight of the noble domes of the mosques at Beejapoor filled him
with a fervour of bigotry even stronger than the lust of territorial
dominion, to subvert the royal house which held those detested
tenets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>Afzool Khan was also an orthodox Soonnee. He looked with
abomination upon the Sheea ceremonies at the great mosque. He
could not join in prayer there, nor could he enter save with the
certainty of being offended and insulted by the religious ceremonies
of his King. It was equally certain that the doctrines he professed
belonged to a strong party in the city, who on all possible occasions
urged amalgamation of the country with the empire of Delhi, in
order to insure the supremacy of their own creed. Yet he was true.</p>

<p>Like him, the minister Khan Mahomed had been faithful through
many temptations; but of late, though he still preserved a fair and
honest appearance with the young King, rumour had become busy
with his name, and, intimate as was their friendship, the old Khan's
trust in him was much shaken under an accumulated mass of
suspicion, though, as yet, nothing definite had transpired. Hitherto
also the minister's apparently unflinching adherence to what was
feared to be a falling dynasty, and to a government which, under
foreign invasion, and internal disunion and distraction, had become
weakened, had retained Afzool Khan's respect and affection; for
this, combined with Khan Mahomed's professed devotion to the
young King, who, with excellent dispositions and a fair promise of
ability, was yet without experience, formed a strong bond of union
between them.</p>

<p>Private friendship, and the free intercourse of camps and battle-fields,
had existed for many years; and as their children grew up
together, and the beauty of Zyna became notorious, the minister's
son, whom we have already mentioned, pressed upon his father,
very importunately, the necessity of formally asking her in marriage.
But under his own secret hopes of the eventual ascendancy of the
Moghuls, and his convictions that the obstinate fidelity of Afzool
Khan would sooner or later lead to a serious breach between them,
the minister had as yet refrained from taking any steps in the
matter; and on his own part Afzool Khan had been equally guarded.</p>

<p>The events of the night, however, would disclose the real tendency
of the Wuzeer's conduct; and the thought that there were grounds
of more than ordinary suspicion, could not fail to increase the feeling
that he was actually guilty, which for some time past had lain at
Afzool Khan's heart. He had fancied, too, a growing coldness on
the part of the Wuzeer towards him, unlike the spirit of their former
free and unrestrained intercourse; and he could not fail to observe,
in his visits to his court, that men to whom rumour attached the
same suspicions as to the Wuzeer, were preferred as counsellors to
himself.</p>

<p>All this, however, had as yet produced no personal disagreement:
it was only mistrust, arising from suspicion on both sides; but the
Wuzeer well knew that, if his designs were discovered for certain in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
any degree, he should find in Afzool Khan a powerful and bitter
enemy, whose fiery temper and habit of prompt action would make
him a far more dangerous enemy than the young King himself. No
one, also, knew better than the Wuzeer the temptations to which
Afzool Khan had been exposed, and through which he had come
as yet unsullied. He knew that in the Moghul army many ties of
clanship and acquaintance existed for the Afghan, which the service
of Beejapoor did not afford, and that the Emperor, desiring to gain
one so faithful, brave, and skilled in the field, who was also a Soonnee,
had offered rank, titles, and estates, with his personal friendship
and confidence, as yet in vain.</p>

<p>There had been times when Afzool Khan, wearied by petty slights,
uncertain as to the future existence of Beejapoor as a kingdom, and
comparing the wide field of honour in the imperial service with the
narrow circle of Beejapoor, had felt tempted to accept these offers.
But the thought had been as often repelled, and had led to a more
steadfast and more healthy attachment to the young King; and
when Ali Adil Shah, who had but recently succeeded his father
Mahmood, displayed the possession of vigour and manly thought,
and his disposition and talent appeared really equal to the maintenance
of his dignity,&mdash;Afzool Khan's fidelity was no longer doubtful,
and his openly-evinced confidence in his King had rallied the
wavering attachment of many.</p>

<p>A more than ordinary proof of this had been that day given by
the King in public Durbar. The Wuzeer was then absent from
Beejapoor on service, watching the frontier, with a force to oppose
Moghul incursions; and the King had, as an unusual act, invited
Afzool Khan into his private chamber, to discuss the contents of the
letters of which we have already seen the Khan in possession. They
were many, and on many subjects; and the King's trust in the old
noble could not have been more heartily evinced than by permitting
him to take them home for perusal alone.</p>

<p>They were a tangled skein of intrigue, alarm, and disaffection, of
exaggerated rumour and detail of actual occurrences, which were
not without signification in the aggregate. If, in reliance on the
gradually increasing ability of the King, Afzool Khan had no longer
hesitated, but, with the sincerity of an open and faithful heart,
showed that he for one no longer doubted, and that his allegiance
would be true&mdash;others as high in rank, and holding equal or greater
territorial possessions, were not so; and, as we have already stated,
there was much disaffection, not only in the city, but in the army,
and also in the provinces.</p>

<p>So long as the Moghuls had beleagured Beejapoor, men of all parties,
and, we may add, creeds also, had united in the common bond
of self-preservation; well knowing the plunder and devastation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
which would ensue if the city were taken by storm or in the course
of actual war. This also had been foreseen by the Emperor; and his
advices from the traitors within, at the head of whom was the
Wuzeer, led him to the conclusion that nothing was to be gained by
open force at present. Enough that the seed of disaffection had
been sown, which he trusted would, in a comparatively short period,
bear the fruit he desired. On these considerations, Aurungzeeb had
raised the siege, and lay at a distance in seeming inaction; nevertheless
watching the course of events not only with eagerness, but with
astute foresight and untiring intrigue. Emissaries were busy in the
city, and among the wavering and discontented gained many converts.
Money, promises and assurances of protection were freely
lavished, not only among the courtiers, but among the frontier chieftains,
powerful tributaries, feudatories, and zemindars, who possessed
influence over the people, and wherever else it was possible. Village
authorities were also canvassed; hereditary rights and immunities
guaranteed, with confirmation of former grants from the Beejapoor
princes.</p>

<p>All such were openly encouraged to revolt, to withhold payment
of revenue, and to harass the government of the State by every
means in their power. During the confusion attendant upon the
Moghul invasion, many districts had been wrested from the State
which could not be regained except at great cost and by the employment
of separate forces, which weakened the general efficiency of
the army. In some instances, those who had recovered and held
such districts, had themselves retained possession of them, fortifying
the village ghurrees or castles, occupying and repairing hill-forts,
under pretence of assisting the King's cause, but in reality to
strengthen their own positions. Of such, was the Mahratta prince,
Sivaji Bhóslay.</p>

<p>The letters which Afzool Khan was perusing were of the tenor
consequent upon such events. They were chiefly from governors of
provinces, forwarding reports from their subordinates to make their
own views more intelligible. Most applied for the assistance of
fresh troops, permission to raise local levies, and funds to pay them;
while they gave accounts of opposition and imperial intrigue, which
were only too certain and progressive. Others detailed plots and
rumours, or preparations for revolt which should be checked.</p>

<p>Around Beejapoor itself there was perhaps no apprehension; but
everywhere at a distance the same confusion existed, and it seemed
to Afzool Khan as though it were impossible to provide against the
spread of growing disaffection which, if he had before only partially
guessed, was here developed in all its hideous and most perplexing
detail. Letter after letter was thus read and thrown aside, till, weary
of the subject, and sick at heart with apprehension, unable also to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
determine upon any definite course of state policy, he had put aside
the correspondence, and was reviewing the detail in his own mind as
he looked out on the city from the window.</p>

<p>The question to be determined in particular was as regarded the
condition of the country to the west and north-west, which heretofore
had given no cause for alarm. When Afzool Khan himself had
governed it, he found the people, if ruder in manner than those
nearer the capital, yet peaceable and industrious farmers; and beyond
checking local feuds, there was little need for exertion or
apprehension of any kind. Now the governor wrote of large assemblages
of armed men, of habitual indifference to the authority of the
officers of the State, and of the growing influence of Sivaji Bhóslay,
before which he felt it next to impossible to maintain his own position
or collect the revenue, much less to bring him to subjection.</p>

<p>The latest letters, too, described emissaries from the imperial
camp having been traced in disguise to Sivaji's strongholds among
the mountains, and an increasing belief among the people that he
was destined to become a great prince for the subversion of all
Mahomedans; while it was very evident that, by some secret means,
they were being organized either to revolt for Sivaji himself, or in
the cause of the Emperor.</p>

<p>The writer was a personal friend of Afzool Khan's&mdash;one whom he
had no reason to believe would write either from fear or from an incorrect
view of existing circumstances; and on this account his
recent letters had not only become more important, but in a higher
degree more interesting. He had forces at his disposal sufficient to
repress any outbreak, but his knowledge of the people and the
country, and the use they might be put to by the Emperor against
the State at any critical moment, had confirmed apprehensions under
which he had written, temperately but firmly, to the King, not to
neglect or underrate those signs of the times; and to seek among the
counsellors and nobles at Beejapoor such advice in respect to the prevention
of local disaffection as might be practicable.</p>

<p>"If Fazil is right," murmured the Khan to himself, as he revolved
these questions in his mind, "we may obtain confirmation of
the designs of the Mahrattas and the Emperor, which will assist the
comprehension of these letters. But it is strange that they have any
common cause, or that such discordant elements should unite, even
with the hope of mutual assistance."</p>

<p>A low cry from his daughter aroused him from his reverie. As
he drew himself within the lattice, Zyna had raised herself, and was
looking about scared and half awake. "Fazil!" she said. "O
father, I dreamed I saw him laying before me, looking as though he
were dead, and then he seemed to change to you; and I was terrified
and screamed out."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>"Be calm, Zyna," he replied, supporting her tenderly; "thou hast
been much excited, and needest rest, and no wonder that an evil
dream came to thee. Fear not; he is safe, and I am beside thee."</p>

<p>"Safe, father? then he is returned, and I have been sleeping
carelessly."</p>

<p>"No, daughter, he is not come yet. He has most likely taken
refuge from the storm, which was severe."</p>

<p>"In my dream I heard the thunder, father, but it seemed as
though it were cannon. I marvel that I slept through all."</p>

<p>"And soundly too, Zyna; but look, the morning will be fair for
their return," and he opened the casement.</p>

<p>The black pall of clouds which had hung over the city had passed
away, and the wind had fallen, except a cool gentle breeze which
blew freshly in at the window, and rustled among the foliage of the
garden. Here and there the silence was broken by a gentle and
distant murmur in the city, for, early as it was, some were already
astir.</p>

<p>"I will watch now, father," said Zyna; "surely you have not
slept at all. I am quite rested, and will wait for Fazil."</p>

<p>"It is near the third watch of the night, Zyna; thou art not
afraid to be alone if I sleep? If Fazil come not before dawn, I will
mount the Paigah, and we will soon bring him to thee; but I have
no fear now, and say this only to content thee. I will try and rest
my head for a while, daughter; for it is weary, and these papers
have caused me much thought." So saying, he lay down on the
divan where he had been sitting, covered his face with a shawl
which Zyna gently cast over him, and at once fell into a deep
slumber.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII.</a></h2>


<p>Zyna sat beside her father, trimming the lamp as it needed, wondering
much at Fazil's strange absence, and occasionally taking up one
of the papers with which her father had been occupied, and reading
it vacantly. Zyna could read, which was unusual in girls of her age
and class: and, originally of a studious character, she had learned
enough Persian with her brother from their old teacher, a superannuated
secretary, to be of use both to her father and brother; more
especially to her father in his confidential correspondence. Apparently
she found nothing to interest her very much, for she laid down
letter after letter after reading the superscription, and looked out
through the lattice impatiently, as it were, for the coming dawn.
The bright morning star now appeared above the tops of the trees,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
and a glow overspread the whole east&mdash;the false dawn; which, while
it as yet gave no definite form to the surrounding objects, yet relieved
the extreme darkness of the night. As Zyna sat, she fancied
she heard a sound of voices at the gate, but it died away. It could
not be her brother; he would have been admitted at once. Again,
as she listened, and the silence seemed painful, the murmur was
renewed, and she started up.</p>

<p>"It is he&mdash;Fazil is come!" she cried eagerly to her father,
awaking him. "O, father, go to meet him; would I could go myself!"</p>

<p>Afzool Khan listened from the window, and Zyna could see that
the expression of his face increased in gladness, and the revulsion
in her own heart caused agitation which she could not restrain.</p>

<p>"He is not come," said her father; "it may be some messenger.
God grant there may be no evil tidings! Be calm, my child; I will
go below and ascertain, and will return or send word about him!"</p>

<p>Hurrying down to the gate, he found the sentinel in altercation
with the lad we have before mentioned. It was evident that the boy
had been there some time, and the sentinel, being informed that his
young lord was safe, had no idea of wakening any one before the
usual hour of morning prayer. As Afzool Khan approached the gate
alone, he heard the lad's earnest prayer for aid answered by a dogged
refusal.</p>

<p>"Begone!" said the man through the wicket; "thy tale may be
true enough, and the Sahib Zadah<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> may be where he is; but, look
you, the great Khan Sahib is fast asleep, and cannot be awakened.
Everybody is asleep; there is no woman here to send to him in the
zenana. Begone therefore, or lay down at the gate. When morning
prayer is over, thou shalt have speech of the Khan. Till it is
broad daylight, I draw no bolt. If thou wilt not go, at least sit
quiet, for there are gentleman in the guard-room here who might
treat thee roughly if disturbed in their sleep."</p>

<p>The boy was turning away sadly, when the voice of Afzool Khan
was heard calling from the inner court, as he unfastened the door
leading to the larger one.</p>

<p>"Whose is that voice?&mdash;who speaks without?&mdash;why is he not
admitted?" he asked.</p>

<p>"My lord," replied the man on duty, "the Sahib Zadah is not
here, but there is a boy who says he knows of him."</p>

<p>"Was it well, Yousuf, to turn him away?" asked Afzool Khan.
"Suppose my son had had need of us."</p>

<p>"Nay; but my lord slept, and the Sahib Zadah was safe. Bulwunt
Rao only is wounded&mdash;and there were no women to send&mdash;and
I did but tell him to wait," stammered the man.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>
<p>"No matter&mdash;where is the boy? Open the wicket," said Afzool
Khan impatiently.</p>

<p>"He does not consider who may be behind it," said the soldier, as
he unfastened the ponderous iron bars and unlocked the padlock of
the wickets, "and that this may be but a device to attack the gate.
But he will always be headstrong."</p>

<p>"I am here, Khódawund," said the lad, from without, and squeezing
himself through the opening between the wicket-door and the chain
which fastened it. "Behold I am now before you, valiant sir," he
said to the sentinel, "whom you took to be a thief; but I would
have speech of the noble Afzool Khan himself, if it be possible to
have him aroused."</p>

<p>"I am he," returned the old Khan, stepping forward. "Speak
on, if what there is to be told may be said before these men;" for
several had now arisen, saluted their master, and were standing by
him.</p>

<p>The boy touched the old Khan's feet reverently. "Fear not, noble
sir," he said hastily, "for the Sahib Zadah is safe. He met with no
hurt, though he was in danger."</p>

<p>"Ul-humd-ul-illa!&mdash;Praise be to God," broke from the old man
fervently, and was heartily re-echoed by all around; for men were
arriving every moment from the different portions of the court, and
crowding round to hear the news. "Ul-humd-ul-illa! O holy Geesoo
Duraz!"<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> he continued, looking up, "I vow fatehas to thy tomb,
and a new covering shall it have of the costliest cloth-of-gold. But
go on, boy, and fear not. Is there aught for my private ear?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, my lord&mdash;nothing. There was a fray, and Meah Sahib's
attendant or friend was badly wounded. I want a palankeen for
him; that is all."</p>

<p>"And my son&mdash;why did he not come with thee? And who art
thou?" asked the Khan.</p>

<p>"They call me Ashruf, and I am the son of Peer Mahomed Duffadar,
and Meah Sahib could not come, because," added the lad, dropping
his head, "he was my father's prisoner&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"By the Prophet, but this is too much!" exclaimed the fiery old
Khan. "Who art thou, knave, that dares to say the son of Afzool
Khan is a prisoner to any one?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>
<p>"May I be your sacrifice, O Khan," returned the boy, nothing
daunted, though the Khan's angry speech was re-echoed by all
gathered around him. "May I be your sacrifice, there is no harm
meant to your noble son, whom we all know and honour. He it
was who in my hearing declared that, in order to save my father,
he would attend the Kótwal's court; for it was but yesterday that
the Kótwal swore he would have the right hand of the first brawler
taken, cut off, and hung up in the chowke,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> and that he would
degrade the first officer who failed to apprehend those concerned in
any riot. Be not angry, therefore, noble sir, for my father explained
all this, and your son goes of his own freewill. My father could not
help it, you know, my lord," added the boy, apologetically, "for a
man had been wounded, and there was blood on your son's sword."</p>

<p>"Ay! Jehándar Beg is likely to be a man of his word, too," said
the Khan to those about him, "and force will do no good. But it
were as well that my son should be attended, I think. What say
you, gentlemen? So be ready some twenty of you, and call up the
spearmen; the palankeen and bearers, too, for Bulwunt Rao. We
could ill spare him, poor fellow, from among us."</p>

<p>"Nothing could have happened if Meah had taken some of us
with him," cried several of the men at once. "We all wanted to
go," added Raheem Khan, "but he bade us mind our own business,
and took Bulwunt Rao with him; and see what has come of ganja
smoking."</p>

<p>"And Meah might have been wounded or killed," added several.</p>

<p>"My friends, there was need to do it," answered Afzool Khan;
"a secret service for the King cannot have too few witnesses. As
to his life, or mine, or that of any of you, do we not eat the salt of
the King, and should our lives be grudged? Peace, then, and
hasten to get ready: the morn is fast breaking, and by daylight we
should be in the saddle. Keep the boy; he must accompany us."
So saying, he turned back into the private court in order to seek his
daughter, who had followed him. Goolab had been beforehand with
her, and had communicated the news in her own way, with many
marvellous additions, while the Khan was giving his orders to the
men. Now, therefore, on hearing her father's brief confirmation of
Fazil's safety, all past anxiety was at once forgotten, and, with
glistening eyes and a thankful heart, she clung to him as they
entered the small court of the zenana apartments together.</p>

<p>By this time, too, Zyna's second mother, who as yet has been
barely mentioned, had been aroused from her sleep by the prevailing
bustle; and as she habitually indulged in long rests, and disliked
early hours most particularly, she met the Khan and Zyna in a mood
of very querulous character, which arose partly from having been
robbed of a large portion of sleep, and partly from having heard
Goolab's exaggerated report of Fazil's danger. Now, the good lady
had not even known of his going out, nor, as her lord had requested
not to be disturbed, of the manner in which the weary night had
passed.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>
<p>"Blessed be the holy saints that he is safe!" was the exclamation
of Zyna, as she threw herself upon the lady's neck; "there will be
no delay now, and my father will bring him to us. O mother, are
you not thankful?"</p>

<p>"It was well done of thee, Khan," cried the lady ironically, disengaging
herself from Zyna, and not heeding her words, "to send
that poor boy out in such a night as the last has been. Such
thunder and lightning! Naked, too, I hear&mdash;to run the chance of
cold and wounds. Ugh! and thou sayest thou hast a father's love
for him? Toba! toba! I swear to thee, had he been my son, he
should never stir out without my permission. I would take care of
that. He should not go hence, Khan Sahib, until I knew that the
planets were propitious&mdash;a thing&mdash;Alla defend us!&mdash;that some
people care as little about as&mdash;as ... and then to think what a
tempting of destiny it was to send the boy from home without asking
or caring for the positions of the stars, or finding out whether
there was not an adverse planet in a threatening house. As it is,
we hear that Fazil is wounded&mdash;that is, he might have been; and
that Bulwunt Rao has had his head cut off&mdash;that is, nearly, for he
has a horrible cut in his neck, and his head is hanging all on one
side; and," she continued, wiping her eyes with the end of her
scarf, and in a whimpering tone, "all this comes of not asking me.
What am I in the house but less than a dog? O Khan&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Peace, Lurlee!" returned Afzool Khan tartly. "What cross
words are these so early in the morning? Enough for thee that
the boy is safe, and that we have subject for thankfulness in his
escape from danger, and not of sorrow. Peace! is it thus Alla
should see thee after His mercy? Fazil will be here presently, and
will tell thee perhaps as much as I know."</p>

<p>"Ay, perhaps!" retorted Lurlee. "I, who am less than a cat in
the house, and as gentle as a sheep, am thus treated! O Khan!
shame upon thee that I know everything only when it is stale, and
comes to me through the bazar! Are not all your goings and
comings hidden from me? and now I hear you and Zyna sat up all
night together; and I was told you were not to be interrupted, and
had to eat my dinner by myself, and to get to sleep as best I might.
O Khan! am I less than nobody? I who am of the family of&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thou wouldst only have been anxious and fretful, Lurlee," returned
the Khan soothingly. "The planets would have troubled
thee. We meant only well in not telling thee. It was an urgent
matter, and we could not wait for the astrologer to read the tables
for us, or tell us what star was in the ascendant. Go, see after some
breakfast, or whatever can be got for Fazil; we may be detained,
and I'll warrant he is hungry enough already. We cannot wait for
lucky hours sometimes, but must take what Alla sends us."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>"I will not go, Khan. I will not be put off with empty words,"
she cried, angrily; "and if you do not choose to read the stars,
what does it signify? are not the consequences of your error on
your own head? When was it that the stars were aught in your
eyes? Have I not read you many a warning, which, had it been
heeded, would have saved much trouble&mdash;much! When Fazil went
forth to battle, did I not warn you not to let him depart? and did
he not come home wounded and senseless? And when I told you
one day, when one of the horses died, that something bad must
befall us because of the evil aspect of the stars, I was only laughed
at. Is this true or false? And yesterday, if I had but been asked
beforehand, could I not have told all that was going to happen?
Behold!" and the lady drew from her bodice a table regularly constructed
to aid her astrological predictions and researches&mdash;"behold!
were not Saturn and the Moon in conjunction? Is not that bad
enough? and cannot you see that is the reason why Bulwunt Rao,
poor fellow, has had his head cut off?"</p>

<p>"Peace, Lurlee!" again cried the Khan, to whom his wife's
astrological wisdom had long proved a serious annoyance. "If all
the planets in the sky had come together for good or evil, Fazil
must have gone last night, for it was an errand of life or death.
Now all is safely over, go and prepare some sheernee for distribution,
and be thankful for what is, rather than anxious about the stars&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Toba, toba!" exclaimed the lady, interrupting him; "for shame,
for shame! O Khan, to blaspheme the stars! May your sin be
forgiven!"</p>

<p>"Nay, mother, but he did not blaspheme," urged the gentle voice
of Zyna. "He did but mean that Fazil was safe everywhere; for
thou knowest, dear mother, that he is in the hands of Alla, and that
the blessed Alla is above all."</p>

<p>"He is not above the stars," retorted the lady angrily, and over-anxious
to establish the truth of her favourite superstition&mdash;"that
is, He&mdash;I mean&mdash;He is above them; but then&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah, Lurlee; better leave them alone," cried the Khan, laughing.
"Art thou not sinking deep into the mire of thine own
conceit, lady? Well, thou art welcome to them if they will teach
thee not to be wilful, and not to do thine own desire, which is ever
ill controlled and variable; and as to their being higher than Him
who made them&mdash;why, I have no more to say."</p>

<p>"I said no such thing," retorted the lady doggedly; "but it is
ever thus. Take care, Khan, of wilful disregard of warnings."</p>

<p>"Another time, perhaps, wife. Now we cannot delay, for the
Kótwal has got hold of Fazil, and that is worse than an adverse
conjunction of planets. But fear not," he added, seeing that the
countenance of Zyna betrayed alarm; "a word from me, and he
will be released."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>"If he is not, I will go to my cousin the Wuzeer's wife, and beg
for him," replied Lurlee.</p>

<p>"Ay, in spite of the stars? Well, well, beebee, I hope it will
not be needed," said the Khan cheerily. "We are not yet come
down to asking favours of our cousins' wives. No, Lurlee; keep
thine interest for another time, and see to it that thy cousin doth
not require thine aid ere thou hast to ask hers."</p>

<p>"Impossible, Khan!" cried the lady sharply. "Thou art pleased
this morning to underrate my poor self and my relations. It is
well, O Afzool Khan!" (she meant to be very impressive when she
called him by name)&mdash;"it is well&mdash;I say it is very well, that you
speak thus. See to it that thou, too, want no aid from them."</p>

<p>"I do not need them, Lurlee," replied the Khan. "As to their
aid to me&mdash;nay, be not angry&mdash;I have not much hope of it; and
for the rest, if I am right in what I think, there is evil impending
over the Wuzeer's house, which all the stars will not tell thee of,
nor him either. May the saints avert it! If it be true, thou shalt
know of it ere many hours be past, and we will try to aid him; but
at present let there be peace between us. By-and-by thou wilt say
to Fazil, It was well done, though our news may not please thee.
Go, girl, bring me my sword," he continued to Zyna. "Bring a
shawl too, for the morning air is chilly."</p>

<p>Zyna was glad to escape, for, in truth, bickerings such as we have
noted were too frequent in the house to be very tolerable, and sometimes
one side, sometimes the other, was in fault; most frequently
perhaps, the lady, who, having had no children of her own to care
for, and having in her youth been instructed in Persian, had turned
to divinity and astrology with great zeal. In the latter she had
indeed great faith, and professed herself able, as no doubt she was
willing, to direct all affairs of the house, as also of the state, by
planetary influences. Thus, no event could happen without its
being, to her perception, plainly written in the book of destiny,
which the light of the planets rendered easy reading; and if a dish
happened to break, or a cow or bullock died, or a horse had to be
purchased or exchanged, or any household rejoicing made, or trouble
endured, all were found to have connection with the planets, or to
be the consequences of the lucky or unlucky days and hours of
which her life was composed.</p>

<p>Lurlee Khánum being a scholar, was also an object of envy to many
of her female friends, and was consulted by them upon various
turns of their fortunes; and in regard to lucky colours for dress,
lucky moments for putting on new clothes, settling matches and
marriage days, the weaning of children, putting them into new beds,
cutting their hair or nails, and the like domestic matters, she was
an unquestionable authority. She, according to the rules laid down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
in her book, had written several charms, and given them to her
friends, which, together with the virtues of certain herbs and medicines,
had been the cause of relief to babies when cutting their
teeth, and when they cried at night, or had bad dreams, or infantine
ailments; and had been efficacious also in averting evil spirits, evil
eyes, and the envious wishes of others.</p>

<p>For these accomplishments&mdash;especially her skill in astrology,
which was believed to be very wonderful, indeed almost a special
revelation&mdash;Lurlee Khánum was held in vast respect by all classes
in her quarter of the city; and her opinions and interpretations
of the stars were decidedly preferred to those of Meer Anwur
Ali, the old Moolla of the public mosque nigh at hand; and a considerable
feud existed between them in consequence. For the
Moolla considered her as an interloper, and as one by no means instructed
or qualified to have converse with what she professed,
whether astrology or medicine; and had been known to say, irreverently
no doubt, that more people died of Lurlee Khánum's medicines
than the angel of death knew what to do with. In short,
Lurlee Khánum, the second wife of Afzool Khan, was a much more
popular person than the first had been; who, being a foreigner, and
absorbed in her husband and children, cared little about her neighbours;
whereas her successor was in most respects the exact reverse.</p>

<p>Lurlee Beebee had once been handsome. She was of somewhat
dark complexion, but had very large lustrous eyes, with a prominent
nose, and had not escaped marks by smallpox, though they were not
disfiguring. When the Khan married her, her figure was perfect;
but she had lately, much to her mortification, increased in size; and
though she took many infallible receipts to prevent fat, it would
accumulate. For many years she had had hope of children, and
had made vows to all the shrines in Beejapoor, had sent gifts to those
at Allund, Gulburgah, and Gôgi, and had vowed to make vast distributions
of money, and to do other charitable acts, if her prayers
were granted. Now she began to fear she had no chance, which had
vexed her not a little, and had combined, with other troubles, to
give a sour, grim expression to her countenance, which rarely left it.</p>

<p>There were times, however, when she was bright and pleasant;
for, really kind at heart, few had greater powers of pleasing than
Lurlee Khánum; but as her husband became more and more occupied
with public affairs, estrangement had begun, and was progressing.
There was one fear which had beset Lurlee for many years&mdash;that
her lord, seeing she had no children, would marry again; and the
idea of a sister-wife was very intolerable: this, however, had passed
away. The Khan was advancing in years, his children were growing
up, and she had no fear of another usurping what affection remained,
or interfering with her household management.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>To the Khan's children Lurlee was fondly attached; indeed, they
were now the principal links between her lord and herself. Their
mother had died when they were of tender age; and, after Lurlee's
hopes of children ceased, she took more kindly to them than before,
and had done her duty by them. Nor did their father interfere
with that deference to her judgment in matters concerning
them, of which she had better knowledge; but her increasing faith
in her own infallibility had begun to distress both, as they could not
help estimating at its proper value the superstition upon which the
majority of her acts and opinions were founded once for all.</p>

<p>Such was Lurlee Khánum, the only lady in the harem of Afzool
Khan. Other nobles of his rank would have married as often as the
law allowed, without reproach; but the old Khan's affections had
seemingly died with Zyna's mother; and the excitement of war, of
political events, and provincial government, together with the
management of his fine estate of Afzoolpoor, had apparently filled
his mind to the exclusion of other subjects.</p>

<p>In a few moments Zyna had returned, bearing the weapon, which
her father took from her; and having entered the garden with her,
they performed their ablutions in the mosque before mentioned,
and went through the usual forms of the early prayer. The Khan
then returned to the zenana, where Lurlee Khánum met him.</p>

<p>"I have put up some food in the palankeen," she said; "see that
Fazil eats it. I would all this were safely over," she added, after a
pause. "Thou art not angry with me, Khan&mdash;with your Lurlee?
do not go forth angry with me, my lord."</p>

<p>"No, no! not angry, dear one," returned the Khan, much moved
and softened. "I am not angry, but impatient; forgive me, Lurlee.
Alla keep you till I return: and you too, my child! Fear not; I will
bring him safely to both of you."</p>

<p>The Khan's horse awaited him in the outer court, and with it a
strong troop of his best horsemen, with a company of spearmen,
whose combined force seemed enough to have rescued Fazil, had
there been need. Afzool Khan was greeted heartily by all, and as
he cast his eye over the group of steady and oft-tried retainers, he
felt that confidence which results from habitual companionship with
others, and that no danger could reach Fazil which they could not
share or overcome. The greeting was as heartily returned as given;
and the gates being thrown open after a few questions to his son's
messenger, and preceded by him and the band of spearmen who ran
before his horse, Afzool Khan and his retainers pushed forward at a
rapid pace.</p>

<p>It was now broad daylight, and the freshness of the morning, and
its clear bright atmosphere, rendered every object more beautiful
than it had been before the rain. Every stately mosque and minaret,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
palace and mausoleum, with their bright gilded spires, caught the
fast-increasing light, and stood out boldly against the clear eastern
sky; while the rich foliage of the trees, unmoved by any wind as
yet, hung in heavy masses, and seemed refreshed by the moisture
they still retained. As they passed the various gardens, the rich
fragrance of tuberose, lime, and orange flowers loaded the air almost
to excess; while the very ground gave forth that refreshing earthy
scent which, in India, after rain, mingles so peculiarly and yet so
gratefully with every other perfume. Few persons were yet abroad;
and with the exception of an occasional devout Mahomedan proceeding
to early morning prayer at the mosque&mdash;a young rake, with
a small band of sword-and-bucklermen, returning from the night's
questionable companionship&mdash;a few humble carriers of fruit and
vegetables coming from villages without the walls to the morning
market, with here and there small companies of travellers starting on
their daily journey,&mdash;all was silent and deserted; and the heavy
tramp of the horsemen, as they proceeded at a rapid pace, sounded
strange and suspicious at that unusual hour.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII.</a></h2>


<p>The young Ashruf ran lightly along before the party, leading them,
by narrow lanes and streets familiar to him, direct to the spot where
the occurrences of the night had taken place; and under such
guidance&mdash;for the boy's speed never flagged for a moment&mdash;Afzool
Khan and his men arrived at the building where Fazil was waiting,
almost ere the sun's rays were sparkling upon the tall minarets and
domes of the city.</p>

<p>He had looked anxiously for their coming long ere dawn broke;
for he had awakened as usual for the morning prayer, in which he
was joined by the Duffadar and several other devout members of
the guard: and since its conclusion he had been sitting on the step
of the guard-room, or watching Bulwunt, who slept heavily but
restlessly, and speculating on the reason of his young messenger's
delay. Truly cheering was it, therefore, after hearing from a great
distance the rapid advance of a body of horsemen borne on the still
morning air, to see the well-known band of spearmen, led by the
young Ashruf, turn the corner of the street, and immediately
following them the tall figure of his father, and with him perhaps
fifty of the Paigah.</p>

<p>A few moments served to bring the party to the spot. As his
father strove to alight rapidly, Fazil sprang to aid him with a joyful
cry; and when the old Khan could disengage himself from his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
stirrup, a hearty embrace followed, to the no small wonder of a
crowd of neighbours, whom the unexpected appearance of a well-known
nobleman and his dashing escort had collected: and who
could not understand the warm greeting and embrace between what
appeared to be a Hindu beggar, still much besmeared with wood-ashes
and paint, and so gallant a cavalier as Afzool Khan.</p>

<p>Led by Fazil into the apartment we have already mentioned, the
Khan submitted to be seated upon a carpet; and the room being
partially cleared, he proceeded to inquire into the circumstances of
his son's detention, and of the fray of which Ashruf had informed
him. Upon Bulwunt, the sound of the old Khan's voice acted like
a charm. Weakened by loss of blood, he had fallen into a dreamy
kind of doze rather than sleep, which the trampling of the horses,
and exclamations from their riders as they arrived, had converted
into an imaginary battle-field, on which he lay wounded and
helpless; but when the well-known voice of his lord was no longer
doubtful, he was aroused, and, raising himself feebly, earnestly
requested his master to come to him to hear, as he thought them,
his last words.</p>

<p>"He is not in fault, my lord," he said faintly, and pointing to
Fazil. "They would have made out that he wounded me&mdash;may
their tongues rot! He will tell you all that happened, and how
the enemy of my house, Tannajee Maloosray, has given me my
death-blow."</p>

<p>"Not so, brave Bulwunt," said the Khan, cheerfully; "there is
no fear of thee, methinks. Thou art weak, and thy sight fails
thee; but keep a good heart, friend, thou will strike many a blow
yet for Afzool Khan; a few days' rest, and this trouble will be
forgotten."</p>

<p>"Has he told you all?" asked Bulwunt.</p>

<p>"Not yet, not yet, friend; but I shall hear it ere long."</p>

<p>"Track him, track him, my lord," continued Bulwunt; "Maloosray
cannot be gone far. He is even now in the city, at one of the
Mutts or Serais. He could not escape if the gates were watched.
He might even be found at&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But speech suddenly failed the poor fellow, and, exhausted with
his effort, he sank back, fainting, on the pillow.</p>

<p>"What did he say, son?" asked the Khan, quickly; "what of
Tannajee Maloosray? Him of Pertábgurh&mdash;the friend of Sivaji
Bhóslay?"</p>

<p>"Even so, father," replied Fazil. "I did not mention him, as
there were so many listeners, and the matter was for your private
ear; but, as Bulwunt has said it, no matter now. Would that we
knew his haunts! Perhaps he knows, but he is too exhausted to
speak."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>"Tannajee Maloosray here!&mdash;in Beejapoor!" exclaimed the
Khan, "and hath done this deed! O that we knew where the
villain were hiding! Nevertheless, the gates shall be well guarded;
that was a good thought of thine, Bulwunt. Ho, without there!
One of ye ride to each gate of the city&mdash;tell those on guard there,
that Maloosray hath been seen within the city last night, and all
that pass out are to be well looked to. Do ye hear?"</p>

<p>"Jo Hookum," cried a number of the men who heard the order;
and after a brief consultation together, single horsemen dashed
away to the several places to which their errands tended.</p>

<p>"And now change thy dress, son," continued his father; "this
disguise is hardly seemly to thee. Here is a suit, and there will be
water outside."</p>

<p>"If the Duffadar here have no objection," returned the young
man. "You forget, father; I am his prisoner of my own free will."</p>

<p>"Chut, chut, boy! thou art no prisoner&mdash;be quick," cried the
Khan.</p>

<p>"The saints forbid," interposed the Duffadar, "that any one of
such exalted faith as the son of Afzool Khan should be ever suspected
of being an infidel. When&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There, there, Fazil! go!" interrupted the Khan, laughing; "I
have no eyes for thee in that abomination; let us see thee in thy
proper shape."</p>

<p>"Then follow me, father, into this apartment," replied Fazil; "I
have that to say which will not bear witnesses&mdash;much that is
marvellous."</p>

<p>"That I doubt not, son. I will follow when Bulwunt is cared
for; I see they have brought up the palankeen."</p>

<p>So saying, the Khan tried to raise the wounded man, while he
spoke cheerily to him. Again, at the sound of his lord's voice, the
spirit of the retainer rallied, but it apparently hovered between life
and death; for, after another faint attempt to speak, he fell back
exhausted.</p>

<p>"It is of no use," muttered the Khan; "he will die, I fear, and we
can ill spare him. Ho, without! bearers or spearmen! Come in
some of ye. And look ye," he added, as several entered, "take up
Bulwunt Rao, carefully, as he lies, by the corners of the blanket;
put him into the palankeen, and take him home at your easiest
pace. He is to be lodged in the private apartment of the Khilwut.
Get a bed from the house, and send for our physician directly, and
the surgeon of the palace.... Now, begone."</p>

<p>Carefully and gently the men raised him up, and bore him out.
He groaned heavily as he reached the open air, yet it seemed to
revive him, for he looked around. Some of his comrades who
crowded round spoke cheerily to him, and he recognized them and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
smiled. He was at once placed in the litter, and the bearers, at a
rapid but easy pace, proceeded homewards.</p>

<p>"I dare not have spoken to thee, my son," said the old Khan,
when he had joined Fazil, who was busily engaged washing the
ashes from his face, neck, and arms, "before those people, though I
was burning to do so. So thou hast really discovered something
by the night's adventure. This Tannajee,&mdash;what of him? Tell me
quickly?"</p>

<p>"Alas! father," returned the young man, sadly, "I know so
much, and of such weighty matters, that my soul trembles under
them. I would almost that I had not gone out last night, or that
other lips than mine had to tell thee a tale of treachery and wrong-doing."</p>

<p>"Son! I see it in thy face. The Wuzeer!" exclaimed the Khan,
starting.</p>

<p>"He is false, father&mdash;false," continued Fazil.</p>

<p>"Ah, I feared so; but speak, boy, how is it? Who told thee?"
cried Afzool Khan, impatiently.</p>

<p>"I need not say more to confirm it than that the King knows
it," returned Fazil; "and that he has papers now in his possession
which leave no doubt of Khan Mahomed's treachery; Mirza Anwur
Ali and the Shah took them last night, and paid for them."</p>

<p>"Ya Alla kureem! and where was this? By the Prophet, tell
me, Fazil! My soul eats your words! speak, boy, quickly."</p>

<p>Then Fazil rapidly sketched the scene of which the reader already
knows the detail, while the old Khan listened in silent amazement,
his forefinger between his teeth.</p>

<p>"Ya Khubeer-o! and hath all this been so easily found out?"
he exclaimed. "Ah, Khan Mahomed! often has your poor friend
warned you; but in vain. Now you are lost, alas, alas! and for
that insane ambition which would not be repressed."</p>

<p>"We must save him, father!" cried Fazil; "he must not perish.
At the risk of my own life would I do aught possible to avert the
danger which threatens him. What can we do? Implore the
King to spare the ancient friend of his house? or write and warn
him? Ah, father, you are his most valued friend, and his son is
as a brother to me! Speak; what can be done?"</p>

<p>"Alas, I know not yet, son," he replied, sadly; "but tell it again;
all, Fazil&mdash;all that the King said. I will think it over. Wishing
to save, we must not destroy."</p>

<p>Fazil again narrated what he had seen, and, as well as he could
remember them, the contents of the letter which the Lalla had
repeated. But the Khan thought long and deeply on the whole
matter ere he could see his way to action. At last he said to his
son&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>"What I have determined upon ought to suit both parties. I
will go instantly to the King, and try if his purpose as to the
Wuzeer can be discovered. I must take the papers he gave me
in any case. Do thou, Fazil, go to thy friend&mdash;it may be that he
knows all; but, if not, he can be warned of the danger. Timely
submission may alone avert it; but the peril is fearful."</p>

<p>"Alla is just, and it will be as He wills," returned his son,
devoutly; "but we must not forget that Lalla; his presence may
be of moment, and it were well he were cared for; his wound was
a mere scratch, and he may be able to ride; let us send for him."</p>

<p>So a messenger was despatched to bring him, or to ascertain, at
least, whether he could ride; as, if not, a litter would be provided.
To the vexation of Fazil, however, and his father, the messenger
returned, saying that a litter had already been sent by the Kótwal's
orders, about the time of morning prayer, and he had been taken
away to that officer.</p>

<p>"Jehándar Beg is faithful," said the old Khan. "He is as true
to the King's salt as I am myself, else I should have feared the
result; but who can hold the Lalla's tongue?&mdash;that is what I
dread, Fazil."</p>

<p>"And he did not appear over-discreet either, father," replied
Fazil; "however, the best thing we can do is to follow up the
information, and go to the Kótwallee; it is my duty, too, to see the
worthy old Duffadar safe through the matter, for truly he did what
he could."</p>

<p>"True, son," returned Afzool Khan; "and I will accompany
thee. Jehándar Beg may not have forgotten some matters in
which I have been able to befriend him now and then. No; that
Lalla must not slip through our hands, Fazil."</p>

<p>By this time Ashruf had saddled his father's ambling pony, and
stood waiting without, so the cavalcade was soon ready. The
Khan's men were all mounted, and a few of the Duffadar's guard
attended as escort to the kullal, for whom his own pony had been
provided, so that there was no delay; and as Fazil and his father
stepped from the guard-room, the young man's appearance was the
signal for a shout of congratulation from all, which being duly
acknowledged, Fazil turned with a smile to the old Duffadar, and
told him "his prisoners" were ready.</p>

<p>"If I can but assist ye, noble gentlemen," said the old man,
respectfully, "in this matter, it will be a happy thing; and if my
son&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Bismilla!" exclaimed Afzool Khan, mounting his horse, and interrupting
him; "we are no evil-doers, to fear justice. Move forward!"</p>

<p>The building where the Kótwal's morning court was held, was
at no very great distance, in the city itself; the other court was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
within the fort, not far from the King's palace; and they proceeded
to the former at a rapid pace. By-and-by, as they drew
nearer the place of their destination, a horseman dashed on to give
notice of the near approach of the Khan, in order that he might be
met, and greeted in a manner due to his rank.</p>

<p>"What can bring Afzool Khan, the pious and true, here?" asked
one of the under-officers on duty at the entrance guard-room of the
outer court. "He is no brawler or intriguer."</p>

<p>"Who knows, Meer Sahib," replied the person addressed. "In
these days the world is turning topsy-turvy, and one has to see
and believe strange things. There is already a report that the
young Khan is in fault, and has wounded the man who was
brought in a little while ago upon a bed, and killed another; for
a body was found this morning near a temple beyond the fort.
I was at the Bazar mosque at early prayer, and they said there it
would be a bad business. What matter? Afzool Khan has plenty
of cash, and a sharp fine will set all straight."</p>

<p>"I pray it may be no worse, friend," returned the first speaker;
"but I have heard Jehándar Beg swear upon the holy book to spare
no one if blood hath been shed; and here is one man dead and one
wounded to be accounted for. A bad business, friend&mdash;a bad
business; but we shall see. God grant it may not lead to that!"
and he pointed to the corner of the court, where lay a hand in a
pool of blood&mdash;a ghastly evidence of summary justice on a criminal
but just performed. "But we shall see; the Khan is heavily
attended, and methinks it would be as well to let him alone."</p>

<p>"Ay, friend, he is one of the old stock, well tried and trusted;
the peace of God and the Prophet be upon him and his; and that
is a brave boy, 'tis a pity he should be in any trouble. Would we
had more of them about the King! Truth is lie, and lie is truth,
friend, in these days; and men whisper that Jehándar Beg is no
friend to Afzool Khan, nor the Wuzeer either, and they are of the
same party; but we shall see. What will be, will be."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXIX">CHAPTER XXIX.</a></h2>


<p>Almost as they spoke, the Khan's retinue approached, and, preceded
by its band of spearmen, some horsemen, and the party of
the old Duffadar, swept round the corner of the adjoining street.
Very conspicuous among the cavalcade were the figures of the
father and son riding together; the Khan in his morning suit of
heavy cloth-of-gold, which glittered richly in the sun; his son,
plainly dressed in white muslin.</p>

<p>Fazil rode a led horse of his father's, which he sat with perfect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
confidence and control of the fiery animal; but his countenance expressed
anxiety which he could not restrain. In truth, he felt,
notwithstanding his assurance to his father, that if he were subjected
to a strict examination, he should be ill able to account
satisfactorily for the various events of the night without compromising
others. In regard to Maloosray, he had one witness in the
kullal; and there was nothing to implicate him in the occurrence
at the temple, in case it should form subject of inquiry. No, he
could not now recede.</p>

<p>As to the old Khan himself, no thought of fear disquieted him.
He considered that he was only humouring a whim of his son's in
accompanying him, that he might insure the Duffadar's being freed
from blame. Suspicion of aught affecting the safety or honour of
his house had never entered his mind; and he had ridden along
gaily, causing his fine war-horse to caracole and bound, free from
all thought of uneasiness, except what might result from the delay.</p>

<p>As the party entered the gate, they were met by several persons
deputed to receive them, and returned the respectful and hearty
greetings of the soldiery on duty, to whom they were well known.
Dismounting at the end of the court, they passed through to the
next, where already many suitors and complainants were assembled.
There, too, on a bed which had been placed in a side-room, lay the
Lalla, with a sheet drawn over him, which Fazil saw was stained
with blood. The Lalla had covered his face; but the pink colour
of his turban, and its peculiar tie, were not to be mistaken. So,
passing all, and receiving and returning salutations, they entered
the room of audience, where, surrounded by a few Mutsuddees, or
scribes, sat the Kótwal himself.</p>

<p>Jehándar Beg was a Persian by birth, a man of some learning
and much cunning, but really intelligent. Those were times when
the service of Indian princes was eagerly sought for by Persians,
Turks, Affghans, and even Abyssinians; and adventurers often rose
to princely rank and honour in their service. Jehándar Beg was
one of these. When young he had accompanied a relative to the
Dekhan court, the prince of which was a Sheea&mdash;his own faith&mdash;and
where, among others of his countrymen, the historian Mahomed
Kasim Ferishta had been distinguished. He had risen steadily in
the King's service, and proved himself brave in the field, as well as
sagacious and trustworthy. Having attained to his present office,
he was, in the main, respected, and was the dread of all night
brawlers, sharpers, and thieves, whom he punished heavily; but he
was fond of money, and it was whispered that, in grave offences, he
had his private price. After all, what mattered that? Occasionally
a great person was fined, or otherwise punished, and so men's
mouths were stopped, and the Kótwal believed to be a great man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>Jehándar Beg's appearance was magnificent. He always wore
the peaked lamb's-wool cap of Khorassan, and the Persian robe;
and his rich brown complexion, and dark-brown curly beard, grave
features, and large soft black eyes, combined to render his face a
remarkable one, not easily forgotten. The expression seldom
varied; nothing ever caused him to laugh in his court&mdash;rarely to
smile&mdash;nor did he ever express anger. Happen what might, his
habitual gravity never relaxed for a moment, and there was no man
who could tell a lie, conceal a fact, or change an opinion&mdash;or, in
the course of duty, order the torture, and look upon it, with such
perfect imperturbability as he did.</p>

<p>His office was at once arduous and difficult, but he was not restricted
in power. In cases of life and death, perhaps, and if the
criminal were of importance, reference might be made to the chief
legal authority or to the King; but, as far as minor punishments
were needed, the lopping off of an arm, a hand, or a foot,&mdash;torture
and imprisonment, or the like,&mdash;no one questioned the Kótwal's
acts. As chief magistrate of a city which contained a large proportion
of lawless population, he often found it necessary to make
sudden and severe examples in order to check disorder and crime:
and, recently, the city had been agitated by conspirators: parties
ran high; and duels and brawls, generally attended by fatal consequences,
were frequent.</p>

<p>The old Duffadar was right when he told Fazil of the Kótwal's
oath to punish severely the first brawler who should be apprehended,
and he trembled for the consequences of the inquiry into the
night's disturbances. Here were two men wounded, and, as far as
he knew, another who had been taken off, or who had got away;
and one dead body, found near the temple of Bhowani among the
tamarind trees, was fresh, though torn by wild animals, and the
blood had been traced back to the temple wall, on the top of which
some stones had been displaced.</p>

<p>Altogether, matters had an ugly appearance; and the old man
could not help thinking that Fazil was concerned in both affairs.
"May God be merciful to him," he said to himself, "for he is a
brave youth, son of a gallant father; better a hundred battle-fields,
and a fair chance man to man, than the crooked ways of this court,
and the merciless character of Jehándar Beg. Be wary, my lord,"
he whispered to Fazil, as, having made his obeisance and report, he
was falling back to get free of the advancing parties; "Jehándar
Beg's looks are not pleasant this morning, and you need to be
careful. I should not warn you without there were need; be
careful in what you say, and I will guide you by my looks from
time to time."</p>

<p>But Fazil had no fear. Unused to such scenes, he could only feel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
that his word would pass him free from all suspicion, and that his
father's rank and good faith were above question.</p>

<p>To the old Khan, the Kótwal's greeting was one of respectful
deference; and the seat of honour was assigned to him. To Fazil,
however, he maintained a stiff reserve&mdash;so pointed, that the Khan
could not but notice and remark upon it.</p>

<p>"That is my son," he said, after an awkward pause which no one
apparently dared to break, "and I would have you acquainted with
him, Meerza Sahib. Shookr Ulla! he is not utterly unknown
among the ranks of those who are true to the King in Beejapoor,
though he is but a youth."</p>

<p>There was no reply, however, given to this speech, and the embarrassment
of all grew more painful. The clerks and guards looked
from one to another, and the old Khan to them in succession, with
increasing indignation at their demeanour.</p>

<p>"By the Prophet!" he exclaimed at length, ironically, "ye seem
marvellously engaged, gentlemen," as, on hearing him speak, every
one looked away, or into the papers before them, "that a civil greeting
does not obtain a civil answer. Your politeness, Meerza Sahib,
is proverbial in the city; but it seems to have deserted you on this
occasion, or is reserved for thieves and loose women. Come, my son&mdash;come;
we intrude here. Jehándar Beg has his own private work
to do, no doubt, and does not need our company."</p>

<p>"Hold!" cried the Kótwal; and, as he spoke, several of the armed
attendants closed up the doorway with their long broad spears, while
others without blew the matches of their guns. "Hold! Thou
mayst go, Afzool Khan, for what may follow may grieve thy brave
heart; but there is blood on thy son's sword, and it must be inquired
into. Young man, what is this they say against thee? A man killed
in a drunken brawl in the worst quarter of the city? Was this to
be expected from the son of Afzool Khan? Speak, and speak truly,
before God and his Prophet." The Meerza's eyes flashed and dilated
as he spoke; and as they rested upon the young man, who had not
seated himself, they were met by a gaze as bold and fearless as his own.</p>

<p>"I am no brawler, Meerza Sahib," he exclaimed, in reply.
"Astagh-fur-oolla!&mdash;nor drunkard either. Peace, father! sit quiet;
let me answer for myself&mdash;I am not afraid," he added, as the Khan
attempted to rise, and was evidently provoked beyond endurance.
"Ask the Duffadar who accompanied me, and the man in whose house
it happened, whether I am to blame. Their statements will suffice."</p>

<p>"There are two matters to answer for, Meah Sahib," said the
Kótwal. "Were you not in the dress of a Gosai last night, and
another with you? Nay; no denial!"</p>

<p>"I have nothing to deny, Meerza Sahib," returned Fazil. "My
father knew of it, and I went by his permission."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>"Good. Now, Peer Sahib, what happened to you?" asked the
Kótwal of another officer present.</p>

<p>"My lord, it was just before midnight," he replied, "when two
men, Gosais, brought a third person, who was slightly wounded, but
complained much of his neck. He is a foreigner, for he speaks the
Delhi language. They said he had been robbed, and told us to keep
him safe till the morning, when they would come for him; and as
the man was very helpless, we put him on a bed in the guard-room,
and have brought him here. Again at dawn, some of the men were
going towards the temple of Toolja Bhowani, when they saw the
dead body of a man, with a deep wound in his back and a stab in his
breast&mdash;a Hindu, for he had on a Brahmun's thread, so he may be a
Rajpoot; but no one knew him. Several mohurs were picked up by
him and others between this place and the temple:&mdash;the Mutsuddee
has them&mdash;eleven, I think,&mdash;and there was blood all the way along.
It was a desperate cut; and how the man could have run at all with
those wounds, it is hard to say."</p>

<p>"He was murdered, then," thought Fazil; "would I had not
struck him! yet there is one traitor and robber the less."</p>

<p>"And the man who was brought in, what of him?" asked the
Kótwal.</p>

<p>"He moaned and groaned, my lord, worse than a woman; said he
had been robbed at the temple; spoke of Pahar Singh who had
wounded him, Maun Singh who had throttled him, then of the Shah's
secretary&mdash;may his name be honoured!&mdash;and some ten thousand
rupees. In short, noble sir, we could make nothing of the matter,
for he began to weep if we spoke to him, and told us to take him to
the King without delay. So we brought him here, and must speak
for himself. It appeared to me like the dream of some opium-smoker,"
continued the speaker to those about him; "we could not
understand it at all."</p>

<p>"Shouldst thou know the men who brought him?"</p>

<p>"Well, my lord, I can't say for certain," replied the officer, "but
one of our people said they were not what they seemed; and he
thought one was Bulwunt Rao, who is a Silladar of the noble Khan
yonder, and who goes about bazars at night, sometimes; the other's
face was tied up, and he did not speak."</p>

<p>"I was the other, Meerza Sahib," interposed Fazil, quietly.</p>

<p>"I thought as much," said the Kótwal, drily. "Were they armed,
Peer Sahib?"</p>

<p>"Yes, to be sure, my lord," he replied; "would any one go about
in those quarters at night without being armed? Yes, they had
sword and shield."</p>

<p>"Where are the weapons?"</p>

<p>"Here, my lord," replied the other Duffadar, who now interposed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
"in my keeping; the young Khan gave them up to me. He has
another sword now."</p>

<p>"Yes, there is blood on the blade, and here are cuts, fresh ones,
on the shield," said Jehándar Beg, examining Fazil's weapons.
"How, young sir, do you account for these?"</p>

<p>"I will reserve what I have to say; it is no use speaking now,"
returned Fazil, who had observed his old friend shake his head, and
who again nodded approvingly.</p>

<p>"Bring in the wounded man," cried the Kótwal; and the bed on
which our poor friend the Lalla lay, was carried in and set down;
"we must confront the parties."</p>

<p>"Get up, good man," said an attendant Mutsuddee; "this is the
Kótwal; make your reverence, and tell what happened to you."</p>

<p>"Ah, protect me, befriend me. I have been robbed and murdered....
I cannot get up.... I am a poor man and a stranger.
Look at my blood," gasped the Lalla by turns to all about him.</p>

<p>"Who did it? and who art thou?" cried the Kótwal. "Where
hast thou come from?"</p>

<p>Now, it might be awkward for the Lalla to answer these questions.
He knew he had a few gold coins left, enough to keep him for some
time&mdash;for he had been used to poverty, and could endure it&mdash;if he
could only get free. Any man with quick wits, could do something
for himself in the city; and had he not done good service? These
thoughts passed rapidly through his mind ere he spoke.</p>

<p>"Asylum of justice!" he said, in his most humble tones, "I don't
know who did it, but I was robbed in the temple."</p>

<p>"Of ten thousand rupees? Speak truly."</p>

<p>"Ah no, sirs. What would a poor Khayet like me do with ten
thousand rupees? No, but of what I had in my humeana."</p>

<p>"And Pahar Singh? they tell me he was mentioned by thee."</p>

<p>"Ah, noble sir, I am a stranger and a foreigner; what do I know
about Pahar Singh, or anybody? I am very weak," added the Lalla,
in a feeble voice; "will no one help me?" and he lay down, as well
to escape further questioning, as to excite pity for his misfortunes.</p>

<p>"This will not serve thee, whoever thou art," returned the Kótwal;
"answer truly, where art thou come from, and what took thee
to that lonely temple at night?"</p>

<p>"My lord, I am a poor Khayet from the north, seeking service;
and I fell among thieves who decoyed me thither and robbed me.
See, they wounded me also, and tried to strangle me. What more
can I say?"</p>

<p>"That is not enough, friend," resumed the Kótwal; "we must know
how it happened, for others here appear concerned in the matter, and
murder hath been done."</p>

<p>"Murder, my lord!" cried the Lalla, again raising himself;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
"there was no murder, though perhaps they thought they had killed
me when they took what I had."</p>

<p>"Who, Lalla? be not afraid," said Jehándar Beg, soothingly.</p>

<p>"A seeming Jogi and another. They ran away, and left me senseless.
Then two Gosais came and raised me up, and gave me water,
and took me to the guard-room. May the gods recompense them,
for they bound up my wound!"</p>

<p>"Two Gosais&mdash;ah, this may be some clue!" said the Kótwal;
"this agrees with the other statement. Then thou art one of them,
Meah Sahib?"</p>

<p>"I have already said so," replied Fazil; "and my retainer, Bulwunt
Rao, was the other."</p>

<p>"What took you there?"</p>

<p>Fazil considered for a moment. What he had been witness of
could not now be related, and he replied, "It was a matter, Meerza
Sahib, in which I am not bound to answer you. If those it concerns
are to hear of it, they shall know otherwise."</p>

<p>"Beware, young sir!" said the Kótwal, gravely; "there can be
no secrets here."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, I cannot answer. It is enough that I have told my
father of it," returned Fazil.</p>

<p>"Yes, Jehándar Beg," said Afzool Khan, "he has said enough to
prove he was no robber, and that ought to content you."</p>

<p>"Yet there was murder done, my friend," replied the official,
quickly; "blood was on the wall of the court, and a corpse not far
from it, and there is blood on this sword of your son's. He should
clear himself of this horrible suspicion. But stay; there is the other
affray to be accounted for,&mdash;that in the wine-shop&mdash;a drunken brawl,
I fear."</p>

<p>"I am no brawler, Meerza Sahib, nor drunkard," exclaimed Fazil,
indignantly. "The man is present in whose house it occurred; let
him say what happened."</p>

<p>"Let him be brought forward, and let Fureed Duffadar state what
happened," said the Kótwal, authoritatively. "Till then be silent,
Meah."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXX" id="CHAPTER_XXX">CHAPTER XXX.</a></h2>


<p>The old Duffadar's account was clear and circumstantial, and the
Kótwal listened attentively. When it was finished, the Kullal was
called, and, prostrating himself, began by imploring protection,
which was granted.</p>

<p>"It is a weighty matter, my lords," he said, "and needs much
inquiry. May it please you to listen," he continued, after a pause,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
as if to collect his thoughts. "Your slave would represent that he
heard a conversation between the young Khan there and a man whose
name may hardly be mentioned in Beejapoor, Tannajee Maloosray."</p>

<p>"Maloosray!" echoed the Kótwal. "Protection of God! thou
art not mad to say this? or drunk?"</p>

<p>"May I be your sacrifice!" continued the man, evidently observing
that his words had made an impression, "I am not mad, and I
have an oath against wine. I swear by the King's salt, that he
spoke with Maloosray."</p>

<p>"And he was disguised like a Gosai, Fureed?" asked the Kótwal
of the old Duffadar.</p>

<p>"Khódawund! what did he tell you himself he was?" replied
the man. "He changed his dress when his father came. Even
now the ashes may be on his body."</p>

<p>"What said the young Khan to Maloosray?" asked the Kótwal
of the Kullal. "Speak truly, or I will have thee flogged through the
bazar, and all thy property confiscated for irregular hours in thy
shop."</p>

<p>This was what the man feared from the first. Had Fazil
appeared in favour he would have appealed to him for explanations
in regard to the affray, for which he dreaded he should be
punished; but Fazil seemed already unable to help himself, so
he had determined to take his own course in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>"Why should I tell a lie?" he replied, holding up his hands
humbly and with a gesture of supplication. "I swear by your
feet it is true." Pointing to Fazil, he continued&mdash;"He said he
knew Pahar Singh was at the temple, and they sent a man for
him; and if he did not come, that they should meet again. Then
Maloosray said something about Sivaji Bhóslay, and the Moghuls,
and the Shah Aurungzeeb, and armies, and there was another
message to Pahar Singh. Then another man struck a blow at the
Maloosray, and they fought, and I screamed out for the guard, and
Maloosray ran off; but I secured him," and he pointed to Fazil.</p>

<p>"O base-born!" exclaimed Fazil, "thy mouth is full of lies&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hear him," interrupted the man; "he had me tied up till the
blood nearly burst from my fingers, and made me promise not
to reveal this. Behold, my lord, the marks of the cords, and how
my arms are swelled. By my child's head, it is true, noble sir, it
is all true. How could I, a poor seller of ganja and bhung, have
dreamed such things of Tannajee and Sivaji? Do not men
tremble at their names? Search the young Khan, he has papers
which Maloosray gave him. I saw them myself&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Alas, it is but too clear to me," said the Kótwal, interrupting
Afzool Khan, who was about to speak, "that there is deep treachery
here. Deep plots are being laid, but this poor servant of God<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
has a clue to one at least. Inshalla! it will be sifted to the bottom.
Enough of suspicion was there against you, young sir, on the
other matter, but this is graver still. Yield, therefore, Afzool Khan,
and you, Meah; resistance is vain, and I would fain spare blood."</p>

<p>As he spoke, the soldiers and attendants, who had gradually
gathered round them, closed in so near that they could have been
seized or overpowered at once, if the old Khan's sword had not been
drawn by him the instant their movement was made. Now, as he
stood prepared to meet any attack, his eyes flashing and his tall
figure drawn up to its full height, no one ventured a step towards
them, nor offered to seize his son, who, on his part, made no attempt
at resistance.</p>

<p>"Draw, Fazil, draw!" cried the Khan; "let us see which of
these sons of vile mothers will first die. O that we had a score of
our fellows with us, this insult would not have happened. Draw,
boy! a few good strokes will see us clear of this gang of executioners,
and there are enough men without to carry us through the
city. Come on, in the name of God! Bismilla!"</p>

<p>Saying this, the old man advanced a step, while those before him,
so sudden and determined was his movement, fell back as though
they would have allowed him egress. Fazil, however, saw his
father's danger, not only from the chance of a sword-thrust or blow
in the struggle which must ensue, and the certainty of an attempt
at rescue by the men without if they heard of it, but in the disgrace
and suspicion which would fall upon them if the inquiry were
forcibly interrupted.</p>

<p>"Father, father!" he cried, passionately, "do not stir. I
implore you, move not. You know how false this base charge
is, and I beseech you not to let it be said that we feared to meet it,
and evaded justice. Yes, let it be first done on this lying dog, who
has misled Jehándar Beg. See, for one, I surrender myself and my
weapons;" and, as he spoke, he threw his sword and dagger on
the floor, which were eagerly secured by an attendant.</p>

<p>"Degenerate!" cried his father. "Dost thou fear death, boy?
When did an Affghan ever surrender his weapons but with his life?
Fie on thee for a coward, to hesitate to strike a blow for me!"</p>

<p>"Coward!" exclaimed the young man, sadly. "Father, you
know not what you say. Why such bitter words? is this a time
for contention?"</p>

<p>"Khan Sahib," said Jehándar Beg, who had risen with the
others, and now advanced, "listen to your son's words of peace and
reason. You are alone, and, though one or two might fall, there
would be no escape. The blood of Afzool Khan, or his son, should
not flow in a court of justice, but against the King's enemies. Put
up your weapon, and wear it, Khan; and you, noble youth, yours.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
Appearances are against you both; and these plots have been so
long hidden from us, that your poor servant, the slave of the King&mdash;may
his splendour increase!&mdash;has no alternative but to detain you
till the pleasure of the Wuzeer is known."</p>

<p>"Father, I beseech you to listen to reason&mdash;to advice kindly given
and well meant," cried Fazil; "consider what is at stake, and that
the moment we have speech of the King there will be no fear."</p>

<p>Afzool Khan looked from one to the other and around him
irresolutely, and the tears rose to his eyes, and fell over in large
drops. Any advance would have decided him to an act of desperation;
but his son saw the struggle in his mind, and, throwing
himself before him, grasped his feet.</p>

<p>"Father, save your honour," he cried, earnestly; "save your
life by my example. Shall it be said that Afzool Khan died a
traitor, or that a breath of suspicion rested upon the truest, most
loyal name in Beejapoor?"</p>

<p>A moment the old Khan hesitated, but his sword-point dropped,
and he dashed his hand across his eyes impatiently. "My spirit
chafes at the thought of restraint, Fazil," he said; "yet for thy
sake, boy, I submit. But I pray thee, Jehándar Beg, let thine
errand to the Wuzeer be done swiftly, or, by the Prophet, there be
those in my service who would reck little of a rescue. Stay,
I had better write; that will assure them more."</p>

<p>A few lines were hastily written by Fazil, and sealed with the
Khan's private signet. One of the escort was called up, and the
note given to him by Fazil himself, with an order to take the men
home, and a caution to be discreet. The soldier looked about him
incredulously.</p>

<p>"Do you remain of your own pleasure, my lord?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the Khan; "we have business here for to-day
which cannot be deferred. Keep quiet, all of ye; but be ready,"
he added, in an under-tone; "when I need ye I will send word."</p>

<p>"Very good," cried the man in a loud voice, in order to cover
the Khan's whisper, "very good; I understand; it shall be done."</p>

<p>"You had better withdraw to the private apartments, Khan,"
said the Kótwal, respectfully. "I know too well the honour of a
Puttán to question you. Stay there till I return. Refreshment,
too, shall be provided; and I pray you to consider this poor house
as your own while you stay in it. The Wuzeer was at Almella
yesterday, and is expected this evening."</p>

<p>Afzool Khan hesitated, but his son whispered, "We shall be
better there, father, than amidst these curious gazers," and drew
him along gently. He did not resist, but followed passively.
"Stay, however," added Fazil to the Kótwal; "where is Fureed
Duffadar? I would speak with him."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>The man advanced a few steps. "I am here, my lord; what are
your orders?"</p>

<p>"None from me," returned Fazil; "but look you, Meerza Sahib&mdash;for
the sake of justice ask of this good man what that Kullal
told us; for it is in the law that the word of a true believer is better
than the oath of a Kafir. And, pardon me, Meerza, but my father
and myself, in the name of the King, hold you responsible for
the custody of that man. How came Maloosray into his shop, or to
remain there while a King's guard was within ear-shot? Ah, liar,"
added the young man, as the Kullal was advancing, with joined
hands, and about to speak, "no more; thou hast told enough lies
for the present; by-and-by there will be other questions. Beware
of them."</p>

<p>So saying, he passed with his father into the door which the
Kótwal himself held open. It was a quiet, secluded place&mdash;a small
apartment supported upon wooden pillars and arches, which opened
into a court shaded with trees. Carpets and pillows were there in
abundance, and the place was cool and neatly furnished.</p>

<p>"The papers, whatever they are, Meah, remain with you," said
the Meerza. "Shall we examine them here privately?"</p>

<p>"They will be shown to the King only," said Fazil, dryly, "for
they concern no one else; meanwhile I am responsible for them."</p>

<p>"Then I will leave ye, noble sirs," returned the other; "be
pleased to rest yourselves."</p>

<p>"O for a moment's speech of the King!" cried the Khan, as they
were alone. "Now it is too late, and Khan Mahomed is lost.
Nay, son, 'tis a pretty court, and not unlike our own Khilwut; but
I cannot breathe freely. Canst thou, Fazil? it chokes me."</p>

<p>"Fear not, father; all will be well, I trust," replied his son.
"Unobserved, I gave a message to the lad Ashruf, who seems
faithful, to be delivered to Kowas Khan. If he comes, all will
be well, for he can warn his father. No harm can happen to us
except from the Wuzeer, and he may&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He dare not," cried Afzool Khan&mdash;"he dare not think of us;
he will have enough to do to save himself. If the Shah acts&mdash;acts
firmly&mdash;as&mdash;as&mdash;I would, son, were I in his place and were it my
dearest friend&mdash;he should die. O Khan Mahomed! O friend!"
exclaimed the old man bitterly, "how often have I remonstrated and
implored, but you have not listened! He spoke me fair, Fazil,
always,&mdash;see what is in his heart. But what is written, is written.
Let it be; we cannot prevent it."</p>

<p>"Ameen, father! we can only do what is possible to save&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I tell thee, boy," resumed the Khan, interrupting him, "I doubt
whether it would be meet in us to interfere with God's designs,
and to help treachery to escape its deserts. The danger is too great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
to the King, and, next to God and the Prophet, he is to us dear
and honoured. I tell thee, son, we had better not interfere; it may
not be good for us."</p>

<p>"Nay, father," said Fazil, "so long as we speak friendly truth
and warning, there can be no fear; and what is written in the
Wuzeer's destiny will be fulfilled."</p>

<p>"Thou wilt see to that door with thy life, Nasir," whispered the
Kótwal to one of his chief attendants, a burly Abyssinian slave.
"See that no one passes out or in without my orders. If violence
is attempted, strike,&mdash;dost thou hear?&mdash;to the death! Proud as
Afzool Khan is, he may yet lower his head, perhaps with his life.
And they have papers, which we must take, Nasir&mdash;forcibly, if we
cannot otherwise get them:&mdash;ere the sun sets, too, or he passes
hence."</p>

<p>"Are we strong enough to keep the Khan, my lord?" asked the
man doubtingly.</p>

<p>"Ay, true; we need be stronger; send this ring," and he took off
his signet, "to the Wuzeer's son. Say we need five hundred men
to reinforce the guard. Yes, we should otherwise be too weak,
if those mad Affghans were to attempt a rescue. Return here
when the messenger goes."</p>

<p>"On my head and eyes be it," replied the slave; "no one shall
pass hence save over my dead body."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXI" id="CHAPTER_XXXI">CHAPTER XXXI.</a></h2>


<p>Maloosray had too much at stake to risk aught by delay, and he and
his companions fled from the back door of the house already
described, screened by the rain and thick darkness, leaving, however,
one of the scouts to inform their companion of what had
happened, and with directions for both to join him at their place of
concealment as quickly as possible. They proceeded at a rapid pace,
leaving the suburb, and striking across the open plain, eastwards, in
the direction of the small hamlet of Allapoor, bearing the wounded
man with them. Heretofore, in his stealthy visits to the city,
Maloosray had found shelter and concealment in a Mutt or monastery
of Jogis, who, in their annual pilgrimages, had become known to
him, and assuming their garb, and even joining them in their morning
perambulations in search of alms, he had been enabled to visit
those persons in the city with whom his intrigues were being carried
on. Now, however, the Jogis had warned him that their Mutt was
no longer safe. Jehándar Beg had received information which led
to several visits by his men at night; and though not interfered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
with, or even aware of the reason of suspicion, the Jogis knew they
were watched.</p>

<p>But they were true to his interests, and had prepared a place
more secure, because without the walls, and more secluded, than
their own Mutt, which was the resort of travellers and devotees from
all parts of the country. This was the cloister of an old Hindu
temple which stood by itself in an unfrequented part of the plain,
and which, either by some act of desecration, or because of its inconvenient
situation, had been long neglected. The cloister round it
was, however, in good repair, and a little plastering with clay, and
cleansing of the chamber from the accumulated dust of years, made
the place comfortable enough; and one of the Jogis attended in
turn, brought provisions, and acted as cook to the party.</p>

<p>It was easy from thence to reach the city unobserved. Not far
distant was the small hamlet of Allapoor, yet sufficiently far to deter
prying persons from coming to see who lived in the deserted temple;
and if any one were observed, it was, to all appearance, only a Jogi.
When, therefore, the Patel, or chief elder of the village of Allapoor,
was told by the shepherd boys that some mendicants were repairing
the cloister of the old temple and staying there, he bade no one
interfere with them; and his goodwill was by-and-by secured by an
occasional present from time to time. No one suspected the place
or its inhabitants; and few frequented the plain about it, which,
being hard and stony, was uncultivated, as it still remains, and was
used here and there for cemeteries; but the greater part was left to
nature, and to flocks of hardy sheep and goats, which picked up a
scanty subsistence.</p>

<p>It was not without some apprehension that Maloosray had first
trusted himself to the new shelter; but in the course of several visits
he had become accustomed to it, and found that he was at once freer
and safer there, than in his old quarters inside the walls. The horses,
too, were excellently provided for in the crypt of an adjoining Mahomedan
tomb, which had never been finished, nor had any use been
made of it. Below the foundation terrace was a spacious arched
vault, above which the walls of the mausoleum had been partly
carried; and the entrance was so overgrown with matted creepers
and bushes, that it could not be seen unless examined very closely.
Within, three horses, and as many stout ponies, found excellent
shelter and concealment; and Maloosray's scouts&mdash;who were, in fact,
his retainers and escort&mdash;lived with them and tended them.</p>

<p>To this place Maloosray proceeded as fast as the wet ground and
the rough by-paths would permit&mdash;supporting his companion when
needful, and helping him over stony places. The wound was not
dangerous, yet it had caused considerable loss of blood, and the hardy
mountaineer was more weakened than he liked to admit. Once they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
emerged upon the plain, the temple was soon reached; and, after
having the sword-cut dressed and bound up, the wounded man was
left to his repose.</p>

<p>Maloosray's next care was for his horses, and he proceeded to the
crypt. Safe now from observation, for it was long past midnight,
the men there were busy with preparations for the morning meal&mdash;for
they could cook only at night. Two were grinding millet-flour
in the hand-mill, which they always carried with them; another was
kneading dough in a wooden trough; a fourth shaping portions of
it into cakes, which he patted between his hands into the desired
form, and a fifth was baking them upon a large flat iron pan or griddle&mdash;which
held several at the same time&mdash;and removing them to the
side of the fire to harden, as fast as baked.</p>

<p>A goodly pile of bread had already accumulated; and in two
earthen pots simmered messes of vegetables and split-peas, from
which a strong, and not unsavoury, smell of onions and garlic proceeded.
The fire, fed by dry sticks from time to time, lighted up
the space around, resting upon the rough stone arches and heavy
massive groins of the crypt; and upon the forms of several men
lying asleep, wrapped in their strong cotton sheets or rough blankets,
while others reclined lazily, talking occasionally to those employed.
There were three horses&mdash;two lay asleep among the men, the other,
a powerful silver-grey mare, was feeding, and looking round occasionally
to the man baking bread, expecting, with a low whinny, her
allowance of buttered cakes.</p>

<p>The scene was peculiar and striking: for the gloom of the vault
was so deep, except around the fire itself, that every object seemed to
stand out in sharp relief as the light caught it. Just then, too, a
brighter blaze than before rested upon the coat of the mare, and,
shining on the soft glossy skin, caused the graceful outline of her
form to project from the deep gloom behind it in a remarkable
manner.</p>

<p>"What! awake, and no one guarding the door? Ah! would ye
have the Kótwal's men upon ye, my sons?" cried Maloosray, entering
unobserved. "Beware, all of ye, the risk is great."</p>

<p>"Master, we had the watch set," answered a man, standing up and
making a clumsy salutation, while others started to their feet. "I
only came in for a moment to see to the mare, for the rest were busy."</p>

<p>"Has she not slept?"</p>

<p>"O yes! She just now woke, got up, shook herself, and neighed.
That was what brought me in; I thought she had no fodder, and
that the others might be asleep."</p>

<p>"Then she is fresh for a journey, in case we have a rapid one,
Ramjee?"</p>

<p>"Ay, master; you may be at Poona in three days if you will, or
at Pertâbgurh either. She will do it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>Maloosray approached the animal: she stretched her head towards
him with a low whinny, and rubbed her nose and eyes against him.
"Yes, Rookminee," he said, caressing her, "thou wilt have sharp
work, perhaps. Art ready, lass?"</p>

<p>There was another low whinny in reply, as she licked the hand
held out to her. She at least understood the caress, and responded
to it. He passed his hand over her sleek coat, which glistened like
silver in the firelight, and down each leg, and taking up each hoof,
narrowly examined every shoe and nail in it in succession.</p>

<p>"Ah! if you can find any fault there, master, you may do as you
please with me," said Ramjee. "No; Balla at Jutt knows his trade
too well to allow a nail to slack, and he knows, too, whose mare he
is shoeing! What does he say? When Sivaji Bhóslay comes with
a hundred thousand horse, then I will ride with him on his raid to
the south, and not a horse shall drop a shoe, be the journey ever so
long."</p>

<p>"And he shall, Ramjee," cried Maloosray, laughing. "The fellow
is a braggart, but he is useful."</p>

<p>"Ah! master, that was a rare meeting. Was it not curious that
so many horses wanted shoeing that day? Well, so thought the royal
horsemen stationed there; and they went about twisting up their
moustaches, and swelling themselves out as you never saw, my lord.
Many good fellows there were, who would not have cared for a chance
with some of those gallants in the open plain. When are we to begin,
master?"</p>

<p>"Ay, when?" echoed a number of the men, who ceased their
occupation for a moment, or raised themselves on their elbows while
the answer was given.</p>

<p>"Not yet, my sons, not yet; we bide our time. And now for
work," answered Maloosray. "Go thou, Ramjee, to the Paigah of
Afzool Khan early, and see if that dog Bulwunt Rao is dead. Well
was it that I tied chains in my turban folds last night, else he had
cloven me to the teeth. I have vowed a silver horse to the shrine of
Khundôba at Jejoori, for the deliverance."</p>

<p>"And was he slain, master, at last?"</p>

<p>"Nay, that is what I want to know," he replied. "But I had a
fair blow at him, and I rarely miss. Go, and bring news quickly."</p>

<p>"Master," said Ramjee in a tone of entreaty, and reverentially
touching Maloosray's feet, "I will go. Let there be no risks like
this again. What would the Maharaja do without you, and what is
there to be gained here that is worth such peril?"</p>

<p>"Ah, yes!" added another, "what if ten thousand such as we are
were expended, it would be nothing were Tannajee safe. Only that two
of us in the lane behind Rama's, misdirected a party of the King's
men, ye had been beset, before and behind; and if the King had got<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
hold of any of ye, the kites and crows of the 'Goruk Imlee' would
have had full bellies by this evening."</p>

<p>"Well, it was not of my seeking," returned Maloosray; "for
Bulwunt Rao was reported dead&mdash;killed in battle two years ago; so,
at least, we heard. It was like fighting a spirit, my sons; and I missed
my blows.... Hark! who is that without? Netta? What news,
brother?" he continued, as a slight, active-looking man entered
hastily. "Didst thou find Pahar Singh, the old robber?"</p>

<p>"Maharaj!" returned the man, "there was no Pahar Singh. We
found a fire burning in the verandah of the temple, and I took a
lighted brand and looked about. All we could discover was a little
fresh blood on the floor and three gold pieces among the ashes. But
there was blood on the wall too, and we tracked it for a few paces,
when the torch went out in the rain, so we went on and heard a man
moaning in a nullah, and some jackals were standing by him as we
went up. Dost thou remember Maun Singh, who is with Pahar
Singh always? Well, we could hardly see, so Limba went back for
another brand, and brought it under his blanket, and then we saw
the man's face. He was terribly wounded, and could not speak
sensibly, but one or two names escaped him, one of which was Pahar
Singh, and Limba knew his face."</p>

<p>"Ye did not let him live, the foul traitor and liar?" cried Maloosray,
excitedly. "O that it had been 'the Lion' himself! Ye did not let
him live?"</p>

<p>"Master, he will speak no more, nor yet tell lies. I have made
that sure enough," said Limba, approaching and touching the feet of
Maloosray. "I knew him after what happened in the old Gosai's
Mutt at Tooljapoor, and Moro Punt would have had me kill him then
and the other too, only I could find no opportunity. They had some
fifty horse with him, and were as shy as deer. Now I have settled
that account."</p>

<p>"Good, my son," replied Maloosray; "but what had happened,
Netta? Was there no further trace of them?"</p>

<p>"None, Maharaj; we were fairly puzzled. We returned, and stayed
in the temple by the fire, in hopes that Pahar Singh might come
back; but it was no use. Then we went and listened behind the
guard-house, and heard there was a man wounded in an affray&mdash;a
'Gosai'&mdash;and there was a barber dressing his wound."</p>

<p>"Then he did not die? I had hoped he did."</p>

<p>"Holy Mother! was this thy work, master, and all of us away?"
cried several of the men.</p>

<p>"No; Ranoo remained with me," replied Maloosray, "and has
got a scratch; but what of the man wounded? What think ye of
Bulwunt Rao, my cousin, dead long since, as we thought, but come
to life, Netta?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>"My curse on him! And he escaped you, Tannajee?"</p>

<p>"I am going to see if he be dead, brother," interposed Ramjee;
"the master's blows are not little ones."</p>

<p>"You see, friends, they&mdash;those two Gosais&mdash;as they appeared,
must have met Pahar Singh, who directed them. I see it all now&mdash;the
villain's attempt to decoy us into that trap by the temptation of
news of the Wuzeer. Depend upon it, he has been bought over,
and is not to be trusted; and he set them on our track."</p>

<p>"He never was," cried both the men; "he has only one king
and one god&mdash;that is money," added Netta; "and he has gone where
he could get it."</p>

<p>"Yes, friends, those men knew us," continued Maloosray; "and
to my mind the place is no longer safe: so we had as well be
ready. If they have given the alarm&mdash;and Bulwunt would do so if
he had any sense&mdash;we shall have horsemen scouring the plains to-morrow,
and that fine lad, Fazil Khan, at the head of them. So
away, some of you: watch the gates; let the horses be kept saddled
all day; and let them have bread as fast as they can eat it. I would
go at once, Nettajee," he added to that person, taking him aside;
"but the Wuzeer must be seen and spoken with first. He was at
Almella yesterday, and will be in the city by the afternoon. Without
having speech of him, I dare not show myself before the master;
and the object of our journey would be incomplete. I think we
may trust him."</p>

<p>"Alas! I fear not," replied Nettajee; "ye are too sanguine, you
and the Maharaja. Khan Mahomed will not league with us; he leans
to the Moghuls, and calls us 'Kafirs of Hindus,' and kills cows
wherever he can. I know it. Why do ye trust him, when he is
faithless to his own salt? Suppose he chose to turn round and hang
up Tannajee Maloosray to the 'Goruk Imlee tree,' would not that
keep him fair in his master's eyes, and blind them to his intrigues
with the Padshah? Ah, brother, trust him not: one who will
deceive the master who has raised him to what he is, will deceive
you. A slave born, he will be one to the last; and he is not fit to
strike in with free men like us! Leave him to the Moghuls, to
whom he will be a slave, as he was to Beejapoor: we have our own
road between both. But come now to Ranoo: is he fit to travel?"</p>

<p>"He will be better after he has slept. We were owls, Nettajee,
not to see through those flimsy disguises," returned Maloosray.</p>

<p>"Bulwunt Rao is better living than dead, brother; and we may
yet bring him round," said Nettajee.</p>

<p>"I tell thee, O Netta," interrupted Tannajee, fiercely, and grinding
his teeth as he spoke, "I would cut him down with my own hand
at the feet of the Maharaja, rather than he should have speech of him.
Never name him to me, else we may differ."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah, that blow of his still rings in your head, Tannajee," replied
the other, laughing. "But come; if you don't need sleep, I do. He
sleeps," he continued, as they entered the cloister where the wounded
man lay; "that is well; and I will do the same, Tannajee;" and so
saying, he took down a sheet from a cord on which it was hanging,
and, wrapping himself in it, lay down, and was soon snoring loudly.</p>

<p>But Maloosray could not sleep, and after a while, got up, and
ascending the steps to the roof of the terrace, looked over the plain
suspiciously. All, however, was still. To the east, lightning was
playing about the tops of the clouds in dim flickering flashes. Everywhere
else the sky was clear, and the stars shone with great lustre.
A few jackals howled in the distance, and their cry was answered
successively in many directions. Then the drums and horns of the
several guards at the gates and on the outer walls and bastions of
the city, sounded deep and shrill one by one, and were taken up by
those in the "Ark" or citadel of the palace, and so died away in the
distance.</p>

<p>His eye followed the line of towers and battlements, and narrowly
watched every light which might betoken a stir among the troops
within; but there was none. The huge dome of the mausoleum of
Mahmood Adil Shah, not long completed, stood out in a dark heavy
mass against the clear sky: and beyond it the outlines of the Palace
of the Seven Stories&mdash;the great Cavalier&mdash;and a confused mass of
trees and buildings intermingled; nearer, too, the massive walls and
arches of the tomb of the mother of the late King, then, as now, unfinished.</p>

<p>All was still. High up in the palace a light twinkled now and
then faintly, on which Tannajee speculated dreamily. Was the King
awake? the light was in his private apartments. What could he be
doing so late in the night? for the drums and trumpets had sounded
the third watch. O that he would join heartily with his master, and
defy the Moghuls! Would no one tell him this was his best policy?
Better a thousand times to secure the fidelity of a large portion of
his own subjects by timely concession, than to defy and coerce their
chieftain. Now, too, though the Moghuls had been once beaten off,
it would not be so again. They were resting and gathering strength,
and one by one the independent kingdoms to the north had fallen
before them.</p>

<p>How long would this remain?&mdash;this, the most extensive, most
valuable, and most heretical. Better far, then, to secure the
Mahratta people, than to lose all by a double war with them, and
with the Moghuls. "Will no one tell the boy this?" thought
Maloosray. "We do not wish him evil; but the master must be
free, and will be free. The people will assemble at the Dusséra, and
the King can then have his choice between a lakh of Mahrattas and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
a lakh of Moghuls, or both combined; and yet this old family should
not pass away&mdash;it should not pass away at our hands."</p>

<p>But we need not follow his thoughts further: better to transport
ourselves to that twinkling light high up in the Seven-storied Palace,
and see who sit beside it, and hear what they say.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXII" id="CHAPTER_XXXII">CHAPTER XXXII.</a></h2>


<p>The Palace of the Seven Stories still exists as one of the most noble
and picturesque ruins of the Fort of Beejapoor. Of the Seven
Stories, only five are now traceable; the two upper have been destroyed,
perhaps by lightning, or have fallen from decay and disrepair;
and it is only in the third that the remains of the beautiful
chamber still existent there convey an idea of the effect of the whole
structure when it was perfect. Even this has been much damaged.
The gilding of the walls, of the groins of the arches and fretted roof,
and of its delicate arabesque borders, has all been scraped off, and
the fresco paintings are so destroyed by exposure, that but little
exists to tell the history of the beautiful Bhagiruttee, the mistress of
the monarch who built the palace for her.</p>

<p>Enough, however, remains to show what the general design and
execution of the work were; enough to prove the exquisite taste
which had directed its completion, and the skill and boldness of the
architect who had raised the dizzy tower so high. Then, the spacious
arches and oriel windows were filled by richly carved panels and
shutters of teak wood, which admitted sufficient light and air: now,
these are all gone, the windows are open, and the rain and sun and
wind are rapidly causing decay and destruction of what remains.
The upper stories are so broken that they cannot be ascended; but
in the one of which we speak, the traveller will be tempted to sit
a while looking over the masses of ruins beneath him: and over the
still perfect walls of the citadel. Beyond, the undulating plain
studded with mounds, shows lines of streets, with broken arches,
minarets, and some still perfect mosques, mausoleums, and palaces,
which have withstood the effects of time and the spoiler, and remain
as proofs of the splendour which once prevailed.</p>

<p>At the period of our tale all these were perfect. The city spread
away to the south and west, covering many miles of plain with those
streets and houses of which the lines of mounds alone remain. They
are interspersed with villages, which are probably portions of the old
city, never entirely deserted, and to which the descendants of the
population of those days have clung through all vicissitudes. To
the east and north, after looking over the greater part of the citadel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
the eye followed the plain beyond&mdash;the proper esplanade of the fort&mdash;and
the undulating rising ground to the north-east, from which
the Moghul batteries had so recently poured a storm of shot upon
the defences, yet happily with no effect.</p>

<p>The King's apartment opened to the west; and, like Afzool Khan
about the same time, he sat courting the breeze, which played gently
round the rich clustered mullions of the oriel window, and refreshed
and soothed him. The storm had died away, and the night was
clear and fresh; while, from the garden below, ascended the mingled
perfume of champas, limes, tuberoses, jessamine of various kinds, and
other sweet-scented flowers, which loaded the air almost to excess.</p>

<p>A silver lamp, on a tall silver stand, stood in a recess sheltered
from the open casement, and its seven wicks burned brightly, illuminating
the chamber, and by their strong light causing the gilded
roof, arches, and groins, with all their delicate colouring of rose-colour,
yellow, light-green, and blue enamel, to assume a soft harmony
of effect&mdash;different from the light of day, yet perhaps more
beautiful.</p>

<p>Furniture there was none; but in the space enclosed by the oriel
window, there was spread a rich, soft, Persian carpet, which filled
its area, on which, in the corner near where the young King was sitting,
lay a thick quilted mattress of green satin brocaded with gold,
and a large pillow of the same material, both covered with fine
muslin. This had been the King's seat, and it was thickly strewn
with papers&mdash;some Persian, some Mahratta&mdash;which, to all appearance,
had been under examination, and he had evidently just left it
and placed himself by the casement which he had opened. He was
alone, but, by the frequent glances towards the doorway, which was
covered by a heavy curtain, some one seemed impatiently expected.</p>

<p>The events of the night had aroused unusual energy in the young
King; nor, since his accession to the throne, had any occurrence excited
him like the discovery of treason in the man he had, perhaps,
most trusted&mdash;his prime minister, Khan Mahomed. It was so unprovoked,
so undeserved. Early in life great ability and aptitude
for business had been remarked in the Abyssinian slave, Rehân, by
the late King; and he had risen, as favourites among Asiatic princes
often do, rapidly to rank and wealth, with every honour which an
attached and grateful prince could bestow upon him. Finally he
had reached the rank of prime minister or Wuzeer, as we have
already mentioned, and, amidst all the distractions and intrigues of
faction, had succeeded in preserving his monarch's attachment.</p>

<p>In this position he was maintained by the young King on his
accession to the throne, notwithstanding the insinuations of many
that the Wuzeer was unfaithful. The King had not heeded these
suspicions, nor, indeed, beyond mere rumour, was there anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
which could lead to confirmation of them; and as the Wuzeer
desired it as a proof of his fidelity, the Abyssinians under his command
had been pushed on to the north to watch the Moghul armies;
for it was better to submit to the turbulence of the Dekhan chieftains
at the capital, who could be controlled by neutral forces like those
of Afzool Khan, than to risk the possible misconduct of the others.
Again, the Dekhanies could not be trusted with the frontier; and
the King, impressed with the fidelity of Khan Mahomed, had left
him at has post.</p>

<p>At this period the Dekhanies and Abyssinians were rival factions
in the state. The latter were more amenable to discipline than the
former, who were descendants of those Mahomedan warriors&mdash;Toorks,
Tartars, and Affghans&mdash;who, at the close of the thirteenth
century, under Alla-oo-Deen, had invaded the south of India, and
wrested the territory in which they had settled from the Mahrattas
of Deogurh and the Canarese dynasty of Beejanuggur. They had
founded, and maintained the dynasty of Gulburgah, against the
attacks of powerful Hindu states, and, when they separated from it,
had attached themselves to the founders of other dynasties, which
rivalled, and, indeed, exceeded in splendour, the parent one.</p>

<p>Those who were in Beejapoor had joined Ibrahim Adil Shah, when
he declared and established his independence of the Bahmani dynasty
of Gulburgah, and they had risen to rank and wealth with the state.
They had been led to victory by that monarch and his successors;
they had conquered province after province from the infidels of the
southern Hindu states, and they had at last finally subdued and overturned
the ancient Hindu monarchy of Beejanuggur, which, for
several generations, was their bitter enemy and rival. Was it
wonderful that they at length became arrogant, and that, to maintain
an equipoise against them, another element, the Abyssinian, was
admitted into this state? It is the old story in the history of the
world of exclusive military power; the old play which has always
been played out when the characters are brought together.</p>

<p>There were proud names among these old Dekhan families, which
still exist, Tartars and Toorks, who ill brooked the control of slaves
like Abyssinians. They were free, and held themselves equal in
rank to their own king&mdash;proud barons in fact, who seldom accepted
administrative service, and were rarely fit for it; men "who could
fight, but could not write," as they boasted; turbulent, arrogant,
quarrelsome among themselves, split into as many factions as they
were families and tribes. The "Dâgtorays," "Alla-ool-Moolks,"
"Bhylmees," "Kalla Chuttrees," "Saféd Poshs," and a host of
others, were faithful to their own state, while they were an unceasing
source of anxiety, and often distress, to its administrators.</p>

<p>So long as the Moghul armies had threatened the capital, or there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
was employment daily in the field to meet a common danger, these
tribes and their chiefs had found occupation against the common
enemy, and had fought valiantly and successfully. The best cavalry
of the Moghul army was no match for these fiery Dekhan cavaliers.
Reckless of life, well mounted, each tribe and appellation vying with
each other, whenever there was a chance in their broad plains, they
had not neglected it, and were ever in advance of the more disciplined
though slower moving bodies of Abyssinian horse and foot,
whom they despised as slaves.</p>

<p>Between the extremes of party were those who, like Afzool Khan,
belonged to neither, who held a common interest and faith in the
dynasty they served, and whose arms had often been turned against
Abyssinians, and against Dekhanies, whenever revolts or mutinies of
either rendered it necessary.</p>

<p>Among these contending factions, and ever present rivalries, the
course of the young King had been difficult and devious since his
accession; but respect to his father's memory and experience, for he
had been a wise prince, a successful administrator, and a valiant
warrior in the field, had, in the end, induced him to continue the
predominance of the Abyssinian element in council; and to allow
the Dekhanies scope for their ambition in military commands and
active service in distant provinces of the kingdom, retaining those
only at the capital who would prove a counterpoise to the Abyssinians,
in case of need. Influenced by personal esteem, and even
affection, for the man who had been his father's most trusted counsellor
and friend, he had retained Khan Mahomed in office, notwithstanding
the evil reports of his Dekhan officers; and under these
circumstances the distress, and even dismay, of the young King at
the discovery of the treachery, which had long existed, was hard to
endure. It was his first bitter lesson in life, and there were few to
fall back upon for advice or consolation.</p>

<p>In his extremity his thoughts had turned to Afzool Khan first,
perhaps, of all: but again, his known intimacy with the Wuzeer; the
report that the families would soon be united by the marriage of
Khan Mahomed's son to the old Khan's daughter; the notorious
friendship of the young men; and, above all, a certain reticence in
Afzool Khan's expressions whenever the Wuzeer's character or
actions were discussed&mdash;recurred to the King, and his thoughts turned
from Afzool Khan to others in succession, yet finding rest nowhere.</p>

<p>Of all his officers, on whom could he depend? Jehándar Beg, who
should have been his executive in any arrest of the Wuzeer, was
known to be his dependent: and thus speculating on each, he
estimated bitterly how really weak he was in personal adherents.</p>

<p>At first all appeared to be decided in his favour, but gradually requests
were made under one pretext or other, which disclosed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
true objects of his courtiers, and the young King had sufficient
discernment to estimate their professions at their full value. It
was these experiences which threw him back upon himself, and upon
the Wuzeer, who was, at least as he thought, moderate and unselfish.
Moderate, certainly, to him; yet, at heart, more grasping and more
treacherous than any.</p>

<p>There was no doubt of that now. Again and again had the King
taken up the letter we have before read, and examined it closely, and
had each time laid it down with increased conviction that it was
genuine. There could be no doubt either as to the seal or the writing.
Khan Mahomed's own hand was too peculiar to be imitated;
yet he had doubted&mdash;still doubted. It is hard to admit conviction
of guilt when one's affections are pleading innocence, but here it was
not to be resisted; and, as most generally follows such conviction,
those very affections were fast becoming the most unrelenting judges.</p>

<p>"Let them but confirm this," said the King, aloud, as he looked
out, and again turned to the papers, selected the letter, looked over
it, and hastily put it down with a shiver. "Let them but confirm it,
and then&mdash;&mdash;O, my father! wert thou here it would be the same,
and your son will not flinch from the necessity, be it what it may."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXXIII">CHAPTER XXXIII.</a></h2>


<p>As yet the King's thoughts had admitted nothing definitely; the blow
had been too sudden, the provocation too great, for aught but a
numbness of perception which checked conclusive determination;
but this was passing away fast, and it was becoming still more apparent
that, if Khan Mahomed's plan had succeeded, he must, if he
survived it, be the dependent of his own slave and his father's.
Were the other letters, which they had looked over hastily, true also?
Men's tongues had before been busy with the Wuzeer's reputation,
and now were so again&mdash;the same subject and the same man; and it
was&mdash;"true, true!"</p>

<p>Unconsciously he had spoken aloud in his reverie, and the word
seemed to come as if an echo of his own thought.</p>

<p>"Who spoke?" he cried, looking round&mdash;"Who spoke?" His
very question seemed to make the silence more impressive; and, as
he strained his eyes into the gloom of the chamber, there was no
sound but the gentle sough of the night wind, laden with moisture,
among the trees below and the open latticework of the windows.
"The spirits of the dead are around me to-night," he continued to
himself, shuddering. "Listen, O father! Listen, sweet mother!
O Prophet of God, on whom be peace, assist and hear me! O thou<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
fountain and dispenser of justice, make me true and bold; make me,
as I should be, thy agent among thy people. If I have been a child
till now, forgive me&mdash;that is past.... He writes to the Emperor,
that I am a boy!&mdash;that I am a boy! Inshalla! No! that is past!"
As he spoke, the sound of voices below, and of footsteps ascending
the narrow stair were distinctly audible, and he paused to listen.
"It is they at last, and the Meerza has not delayed. Enter," he
cried, as the steps appeared to reach the landing-place and doorway&mdash;"enter,
I am here."</p>

<p>The heavy quilted curtain was pushed aside, and three persons
advanced&mdash;one the Meerza or secretary we have before mentioned;
the other two we have not yet seen; but they had been often employed
as confidential advisers by the King, and he had now sent for them.
When they returned from the temple, the King and his secretary
had examined the papers they had obtained, with great care and
anxiety, and they proved to be far more voluminous and important
than even our friend the Lalla had imagined.</p>

<p>The dates of the letters extended over several years. Some, of
later date, within the year, had evidently been sent secretly, for
they were rolled up into the smallest possible compass, in lead, and
so that they could be put into the mouth, or otherwise hidden; the
handwriting was disguised, and several were written in cypher;
but the most recent were not disguised at all, and the seals were
perfect. The whole formed a series, and they had hastily put them
together. Each letter confirmed the other, or seemed to do so, and
yet, considering the issue at stake, neither cared to trust their own
judgment: and the papers needed confirmation, as well of their
authenticity as of their reference to former occurrences and dates.</p>

<p>Of the Mahratta documents, however, they could form no opinion,
as neither could read the character; but the secretary was familiar
with the seal, and even the rude signature, of Sivaji Bhóslay; and
these letters might throw some light on the subject of reputed intrigues
with the Emperor, and prove a guide to future proceedings.</p>

<p>The two persons who had been summoned so hastily to the night
council were, in the first place, Peer Dustageer Khaderi, a holy
Syud, or descendant of the Prophet, of the purest lineage, and the
head of a religious house or establishment of Durwaysh, or, as we
familiarly call them, "Dervishes," which had been largely endowed
by the State, and for whose ancestors, buried in the precincts of the
shrine, miracles were now becoming ostensibly claimed. As a consequence,
the holy influence of the "Peer" was decidedly on the
increase; and as he had been chosen as religious instructor to the
King, he was at that time his "Moorshid," or spiritual guide; and
being a shrewd, well-educated person, possessed of deep local experience,
and, from his position, able to obtain information of a trustworthy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
nature, he was frequently consulted. To give him due
credit, the Peer had proved, on more than one occasion, to have
rendered valuable service. Him, therefore, had the King named as
the person best fitted to be intrusted with the secret they had obtained.</p>

<p>The other was an old Brahmun, who entered leaning upon a long
stick with a gold head, yet not so as to evince weakness, and was as
remarkable in his degree as the person whom he accompanied.
Neelkunt Rai Pansay, in the outset of his life a humble Karkoon, or
clerk, in the revenue department of the State, had served, in succession,
three generations of its kings, and, at upwards of eighty
years old, was still clear-headed, astute, and faithful. He had risen to
the rank of "Peshcar," or finance minister, by his valuable services
in that department; and though an "infidel," as he was termed by the
Peer, was beloved and respected, and consulted on occasions of more
than ordinary solemnity or embarrassment, more particularly in
regard to the affairs of his own people, the Hindus of the kingdom.</p>

<p>While the secretary advanced to the King, the others stood at the
further end of the apartment. Neither knew why they had been
summoned, and the hour of the night, the, to them, strange fact of
being together in the most private apartment of the palace, and in
the King's presence, caused them to look at each other wonderingly.</p>

<p>These were not persons who could ever unite in private friendship;
for the Peer, a bigoted follower of Mahomed, and a holy saint
to boot, was one of those who, as warriors of the faith, would have
led armies against the infidels, and utterly exterminated them. That
king of Gulburgah, Feroze Shah, was in his eyes a true Moslem, and
now surely enjoying Paradise, who, in pursuance of his vow, had
slain a hundred thousand of the infidels of Beejanuggur, and made
pyramids of their heads at the gate of his city. If the kings of
Beejapoor had been such it would have been well; but, alas! in his
eyes they were degenerate. Here was a proof: the infidel minister
sent for to confer with him! the Syud! "Astagh-fur-Ulla!" (God
forbid it!) gurgled in his throat, and he edged away and gathered up
his garments with a gesture decidedly contemptuous.</p>

<p>This did not escape the old Brahmin's notice, but it was no time
to resent it, for they were called forward. A word from the secretary
had decided the King to have the Mahratta letters first examined.
Aroused from his sleep, and in the presence of a Brahmun, the Syud
was not likely to discuss any matter temperately with one; nor,
indeed, in a subject in which Mahomedan honour was involved, was
it politic, perhaps, to reveal particulars to a Hindu; but the fact or
otherwise of Sivaji Bhóslay's attachment or treachery so affected
the Wuzeer's position, that it could not be concealed from one who,
whatever his faults of religious arrogance might be, was at least a
firm friend of the young King and of his government.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>"Salaam-o-alykoom! Khoosh amudeed! (you are welcome),"
said the King, using the Persian salutation to the Syud, and rising
as he advanced.</p>

<p>"Salaam-o-alyk!" returned the holy man, advancing, as was his
wont, in a peculiar but characteristic manner; that is, he bent his
head forward, so as to assume a stoop which might be supposed
reverential, but which was, in fact, patronising in the extreme;
stretching forth his arms in an attitude of benediction, and, having
set his feet nearly at right angles, he shuffled with short steps towards
the edge of the carpet on which was the King's seat. "My lord's
health is sound, and his brain is clear?"</p>

<p>"I am well," returned the King; "be seated."</p>

<p>The Peer looked for a place as near the King as possible, and,
with another wave of his hands, settled himself upon his heels with
two motions&mdash;first, to drop on his knees, and second, to subside upon
his heels, very much after the fashion of a camel when it is to be
loaded. This done, he joined his hands together, and smiling
blandly, again ventured to ask whether "My lord and prince were
well."</p>

<p>"By your favour and the mercy of God," replied the King, "I am
well."</p>

<p>"Ul-humd-ul-illa! (Praise be to God!) Shookr! shookr!
(thanks, thanks!)" ejaculated the Peer devoutly, as he settled himself
more comfortably; then, taking his rosary from his waist, began
to tell his beads with great rapidity, as the old Brahmun, following
to the edge of the carpet, and making a humble and reverential
salutation, stood awaiting the King's pleasure.</p>

<p>"Be seated, Neelkunt Rai," said the King kindly; and as the old
man stooped to the ground, supporting himself by his stick, the
secretary compassionately put his hand under his arm, and let him
down gently. The scowl from the Peer at this unwonted act of
courtesy was lost upon the secretary, but not upon the old man himself;
nor was his look of thanks to the person who had assisted him
unremarked by the Syud. "I will watch them," he said inwardly:
"these two seem to understand each other."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXXIV">CHAPTER XXXIV.</a></h2>


<p>The King spoke first, breaking a silence which, though only lasting
for a few moments, seemed interminably oppressive.</p>

<p>"I have called you, Neelkunt Rai," he said, "to examine and
read to me some papers which have come into my possession. There
is no one about me from whom I can expect more true fidelity than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
from you in a delicate matter. Give him the papers, Meerza; they
are before you."</p>

<p>"May my lord's favour and condescension increase," returned the
old man, bowing humbly. "I have never deceived the State, and
am too old to begin; and as the grandson is now, so were the father
and grandfather always towards me; true confidence is rarely disappointed."</p>

<p>The King sighed. "Alas," he said, "would it were so! Read
and judge for yourself."</p>

<p>Neelkunt Rai took the papers, cast his eyes over a few lines, put
them down, fumbled in his pockets for his spectacles, which finally
were found in a fold of his turban, put them on, and looked first
at the end of the paper.</p>

<p>"The letters are from Sivaji Bhóslay, my lord. Doubtless some
renewal of his former excesses, and his usual apologies for them.
Shall I read them."</p>

<p>"If that were all, Neelkunt Rai, we could forgive them," replied
the King; "but read; we may perhaps be in error about them,
though truly our vassal grows in power, and heeds not warnings or
advice."</p>

<p>"It is only a few months since he took the four forts," interposed
the Meerza, "and the letters given to Afzool Khan mention that he
is repairing and putting grain into them, and that Pertâbgurh, where
he lives, is now impregnable, and that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Let him read, Meerza Sahib," said the Peer ironically: "one so
high in the favour of the King should not be interrupted;" and he
stroked his beard gently with one hand, while the beads of his
rosary passed rapidly through the fingers of the other, and his lips
repeated the particular invocation of the divinity which suited every
bead. "Let him read; my lord is already listening."</p>

<p>Neelkunt Rai proceeded. He had been deceived by the address,
which was that usually written to his own sovereign, and had read
the letter through unsuspiciously; but as its purport became evident,
it was clear, by his change of countenance, that this was no ordinary
communication, and after a while he stopped suddenly.</p>

<p>"It is not fit for my lord to hear," he said excitedly. "This is
treason!"</p>

<p>"Be not afraid, Neelkunt Rai, we would know the worst," replied
the King.</p>

<p>"Yes, my lord should know who are true and who are false,"
added the Peer, pompously. "It is true wisdom!"</p>

<p>"As you will," returned the old man, bowing to the King, and not
noticing the Peer; "your servant is not responsible for what is
written, and you must be patient with it;" and he read and translated
as he went on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>There could be no doubt that the treason was unmasked and unconcealed.
The wrongs of his father, wrote Sivaji, who for four
years had been imprisoned in the dungeon of the citadel of Beejapoor,
near the gate, called for revenge; the wrongs of the people,
suffering under endless local oppression and exaction, called for redress,
which it was hopeless to expect at the hands of a boy, priest-ridden
and under the domination of bigoted and ignorant ministers.
The conclusion was characteristic of the writer. All he desired was
confirmation of his ancestral rights, and permission to serve, with his
forces, in the imperial interest.</p>

<p>Letter after letter was read, all much to the same purpose; those
of the latter dates being more particular, perhaps, than the former.</p>

<p>"Enough," cried the King at last, "we are weary of these details.
What dost thou think, Neelkunt Rai?"</p>

<p>"My lord," said the old man, joining his hands, "mine are not the
words of flattery; nor is my advice given without reason. I cannot
control men's tongues, nor can I hinder the actions of such as Sivaji
Bhóslay; nor yet am I a soldier, to estimate whether his means are
proportionate to the end he proposes to attain. If I may speak, I will
do so truly, and as one who is near death now; but my lord must
not be offended, else I am silent."</p>

<p>"Be careful, and do not transgress the bounds of propriety and
respect," said the priest.</p>

<p>"Let him speak as he will, Syud," cried the King, hastily; "do
not interrupt him. Fear not, Neelkunt Rai."</p>

<p>"I fear no one, because I have no reason to do so," returned the
old man simply, and looking steadily at the priest. "What I have
to say is this: the disaffection of Sivaji Bhóslay may spread, but it
has not yet become dangerous. That it will be so, if not checked,
there is no doubt, for the whole Mahratta people are with him; and
there are many signs among them that he will be great&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That he will be great?" echoed the King.</p>

<p>"My lord," interrupted the Syud, "I know all about that. Some
of my disciples who live at a distance, have come to me from time
to time lately, and told me of the damnable doings of the infidels;
and how this Sivaji is supposed to have revelations from their gods;
but they are but stones&mdash;they are but stones, and gold and silver.
Now, what saith the blessed Prophet, on whom be peace, about such
infidels?"</p>

<p>"Spare us, good Syud," returned the King, interrupting him
gently, "we know the passages; but God hath seen fit to give our
house subjects of this faith; and they are all our children&mdash;they&mdash;as
well as the true believers. We can see no difference."</p>

<p>"Astagh-fur-oolla! No difference!" cried the Syud. "Is it not
written in the holy book, how they shall be burned in the fires of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
hell, and thou sayest there is no difference! Some one hath surely
bewitched thee with sorcery, my son, and I will say exorcisms for
thee&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Enough," returned the King, coldly; "we have not time to
waste in discussion on such matters now. Proceed, Neelkunt Rai."</p>

<p>"The Syud is a holy man," said the old minister, "and he and his
house are venerated, and he should be merciful and considerate to
all; but as he, too, hath heard the rumours in regard to Sivaji, my
lord will believe them. And it would be well not to disregard them
entirely. A people's enthusiasm is not to be trifled with."</p>

<p>"There is but one cure for it, if they are infidels, and that is the
sword," murmured the Syud. "What saith&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We cannot suffer these interruptions," interposed the King,
haughtily.</p>

<p>"Peace, Meer Sahib," whispered the Meerza, laying his hand on
the other's arm, as he was about to rise. "Peace, and be still. In
what will come afterwards we have need of thee&mdash;much need; be
still."</p>

<p>"My prince," said Neelkunt Rai, endeavouring to rise, "I have
done what was needed, and beg leave to depart in peace. My King
knows the worst. What his servant would advise will not now be
listened to, were he even to speak."</p>

<p>"Say on," cried the King, interrupting him; "thou hast a right to
speak. Say on; we will not prevent thee."</p>

<p>"But he will," returned the Karkoon, pointing to the Syud.</p>

<p>"If he speaks no irreverence against the people of the true faith,
he may talk till morning," said the Syud, with a wave of the hand.
"I shall be dumb and deaf."</p>

<p>"I have little to represent, my lord," replied the old man. "It is
hard to say whether rebellion such as this, should be crushed or forgiven.
If I should advise the former, can it be done? If the latter,
I maybe suspected of partiality. Ah, my prince, if you gird up your
loins to fight Sivaji, it will but be trying to grasp the wind; and your
best troops will be taken into his mountains, leaving their places
empty for the Moghuls to occupy, and that were a dangerous risk.
No! send your royal 'kowl' to the Bhóslay&mdash;invite him here&mdash;ennoble
him&mdash;treat him as your ancestors treated the Beyder chief
of Suggur, and you will secure him. If a time of trial should ever
come, which may the gods avert, the old Brahmun's words and cautions
for the adoption of a merciful policy will not be forgotten.
May I depart?"</p>

<p>"Yes, you have permission to depart, Neelkunt Rai," said the
King, interrupting the Syud, who was about to speak angrily. "It
is even as we suspected in regard to those letters, and the Bhóslay's
treachery to the State. We would ask one thing more:&mdash;what force
hath Sivaji in reality?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>"My prince," returned the Brahmun, rising and leaning on his
staff, "what shall I say? Have you no reports? Were not letters
given to Afzool Khan to read? Ask him; he knows that country
better than I do&mdash;far better. Ask the Syud what his disciples tell him."</p>

<p>"No, no; I will have your opinion," interrupted the King.
"Speak! what do your people, the Brahmuns, say about it?"</p>

<p>"May I be forgiven, my lord, if it prove untrue. Yet I will
speak as I hear," replied the old man. "My prince knows that I am
not of this country, nor of this people; I have no interest in them
except as Hindus; but you may be assured there is not a Mahratta
breathing who will not follow Sivaji, and the divine call he is believed
to have received. No man who can wield a sword or carry a gun, or
who has a horse to ride, that will not go to the places of meeting
when&mdash;'the fire is on the hills.' How many there may be, the gods
only know! Lakhs! lakhs! who can count them? Beware of
them, my prince, and secure their chief ere it be too late."</p>

<p>"What has passed here is secret, Neelkunt Rai," said the King.
"Thou mayst go; we will send for thee again in this matter ere it
be concluded," and with a deep reverence to the King, and salutations
to the others, the old man retreated a few paces backwards,
then turned, and passed out of the chamber.</p>

<p>"Blessed be God and the Prophet!" exclaimed the Syud when he
was gone. "The air was defiled by his breath! Ul-humd-ul-illa!
a Kafir and a traitor, may he&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Peace, Meer Sahib, we have dismissed him, and that is enough,"
said the King. "Our father, on whose memory be peace, trusted
him, and so did his father,&mdash;so also do we."</p>

<p>"As my prince pleases," returned the holy man, with a humble
gesture, and checking the volley of curses he had prepared to hurl
after the old Brahmun. "In this matter it seemed to me that his
counsel was cowardly and dangerous. How say you, Meerza? Was
Feroze Shah afraid of infidels when he and his true believers slew
them by lakhs, and the pyramids of heads stood by the gates of Gulburgah?
And is our prince less than he was, or are these Mahratta
Kafirs more powerful than those of Beejanugger? Speak, man!"</p>

<p>"My opinion would be little worth," said the secretary, "even did
my lord desire it, and there are others more capable of judging of the
power of this Mahratta robber than I am. What you have to advise
our master upon is another matter, Syud."</p>

<p>"Explain it to him, Meerza," said the King, sadly: "I am sick of
treachery, which seems to be closing round me like a net on all sides."</p>

<p>"God and the Prophet forbid!" exclaimed both in a breath.
"Treachery known, is soon disposed of. That which sits crouching
in hidden places is alone to be dreaded," continued the Syud. "Ere
I hear the detail, I have my fears."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nay, read thyself and judge," said the King. "Give him the
letters, Meerza."</p>

<p>"I have compared the seals," said the secretary, "with those
letters recently received by the King, and the writing also. Judge
for yourself before you read."</p>

<p>The Syud obeyed. He examined and compared the seals, the
superscription, and the paper of all, with much care and evident
interest, as expressed in various ejaculations of wonder, and appeals
to the divinity under various appellations suited to the circumstances,
which may be spared. "No doubt, no doubt," he said, after the
scrutiny had been concluded, "no doubt of these, nor of the superscription.
They only confirm what hath long been in men's mouths,
yet was undetected."</p>

<p>"Read," said the King. "Satisfy yourself."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXV" id="CHAPTER_XXXV">CHAPTER XXXV.</a></h2>


<p>"It is finished, my lord," said the Syud, looking up, after an examination
of the papers which had appeared interminable, and as he
spoke, the cry of the Muezzin of the Royal Mosque arose in the
invitation to morning prayer, sonorous and musical, "Alla hu Akbur!
Alla hu Akbur!" "It is finished," he continued, "and it is the will
of Alla that morning prayer should come with the last words.
Come, my lord, let us do this service, and ask a blessing on our
deliberation. Come to the terrace in the fresh morning air."</p>

<p>We need not follow them. As they returned and seated themselves
again by the oriel window, the first blush of dawn was stealing
over the sky, paling the stars, and the gentle breeze of morning
rustled softly among the leaves of the gardens below. The ceremony
he had performed, the ablution, and the air of the terrace
outside to which they had adjourned, had refreshed the King after
this weary night.</p>

<p>"Speak, Syud," he said, as they resumed their seats. "What is
it to be?"</p>

<p>"I need not, my lord," replied the Syud. "What Alla hath put
into thy heart I now see in thine eyes, and so be it! Ameen!
ameen! ameen! It is his destiny. He is not fit to live; let him
die, perjured and faithless as he is. My lord, he had sworn on the
holy book to me to be true. He had touched my feet and my neck
as witness to his oath. Yet see, since then, nay, within a few weeks,
this letter&mdash;worst of all&mdash;was written. But O, my prince! there
must be no mistake. Even at the last, let not the blood of a
guiltless man be on our heads."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>The Syud's resolution had wavered for a moment, but was rallied
by the secretary as the King shook his head, but did not reply.</p>

<p>"Meer Sahib," he said, "we have had the same doubts, my lord
and I. Considering how we obtained the letters, can there be uncertainty?"</p>

<p>"God forbid!" replied the Syud&mdash;"God forbid! it is enough. I
see in this revelation the hand of the All-wise, and we, his creatures,
should not resist His destinies and His justice. We cannot do so
even if we wished," and he bowed his head reverently over his beads.
"Hark! what is that?"</p>

<p>"Ulla dilâyâ to léonga! Ulla dilâyâ to léonga! (If God give
I will take! If God give I will take)" was suddenly shouted in an
outer court of the palace by a powerful voice, and interrupted the
priest for a moment.</p>

<p>"Listen!" he continued, grasping the Meerza's arm. "What is
that cry, so strange, and so early?"</p>

<p>"It is but one of the city beggars," said the King, looking across
to his secretary with a peculiar glance of intelligence, "who perhaps
has not slept off his night's potions. One of thine own disciples,
perhaps, Huzrut."</p>

<p>"I will go and listen," said the secretary, rising; and he proceeded
to the terrace where the morning prayer had been performed.</p>

<p>"Ulla dilâyâ to léonga!" arose in clear deep tones, now unchecked
by the heavy quilted curtain of the royal chamber. It was a common
form of cry of fakeers or other beggars; but there was something
in the rough tone of the voice which seemed to strike familiarly
upon the Meerza's ear.</p>

<p>"Ulla dilâyâ to léonga!"</p>

<p>The last cry was followed by a remonstrance from the soldiers
below, who, belonging to the guard of the private apartments, had
evidently stopped the intruder.</p>

<p>"Gently, O Syn," cried one; "what dost thou here so early?
Do not bawl so loud, friend, else they will be awakened up yonder,
and thou wilt be whipped and put in the stocks. Come and sit
here, and rest thyself if thou wilt."</p>

<p>"Ulla dilâyâ to léonga!" was the only reply.</p>

<p>"Nay, but thou canst not enter here, Syn. This is the private
court of the Hareem, and thou must be silent," continued the soldier.</p>

<p>"Ulla dilâyâ to léonga!"</p>

<p>"The fellow is mad or drunk. Here, Jemadar," cried another
voice; "what is to be done with this Fakeer?"</p>

<p>"Who can this be?" thought the Meerza. "This is no common
cry. I must see the worthy Syud out, and get speech of the crier."</p>

<p>"Ulla dilâyâ&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The Fakeer's cry was broken off abruptly, and there was a noise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
as if of a scuffle below. Could it be any one in the Wuzeer's interest,
seeking for information, or perhaps with deadly intent. "Ho
there!" cried the secretary; "what noise is that so early, disturbing
the King?"</p>

<p>"Some drunken Fakeer, my lord," returned one of the guards,
looking up, "who has intruded, God knows how."</p>

<p>"Keep him, and I will come down presently," answered the
Meerza, not waiting for the reply, but re-entering the chamber.</p>

<p>"Some Fakeer, my lord," he continued to the King, but answering
his look of intelligence, "whom I have ordered to be confined
till the Darogah of the palace can deal with him for his insolence."</p>

<p>"If he be one of my men come after me," said the Syud, "he
shall be punished. And now, my lord, have I permission to depart?
Delay not in this matter; and may God give you a safe deliverance
from a traitor!"</p>

<p>"You may go, Meer Sahib," said the King; "and we thank you
for this visit; but shall need you at noon."</p>

<p>"Your servant will be present without fail," returned the Syud,
humbly. "Would that his power were equal to his devotion in the
King's service!"</p>

<p>"Return directly," said the King, in a whisper, to his secretary,
as the holy man waddled slowly to the door. "I know who it is;
bring him hither at once. Hast thou forgotten the Jogi of the
temple?"</p>

<p>"Hither? that fearful man!"</p>

<p>"Yes, and at once&mdash;any excuse&mdash;say he does exorcism&mdash;anything."</p>

<p>The secretary hesitated.</p>

<p>"At once," continued the King, positively, "and without fail. I
feared him not then, when I was in his power and helpless, neither
do I now. Go, take this with thee," and he slipped his signet ring
into the Meerza's hand.</p>

<p>"I will have him searched at any rate," thought the Meerza, as
he descended the narrow stair. "Take care, Meer Sahib, the light
is uncertain. Ah, here we are. Who is that, Abdulla, that was
crying out?" he said to a eunuch, who, with others, kept guard at
the foot of the stairs.</p>

<p>"I know not, my lord. He is some drunken Fakeer, no doubt;
and they have tied him up, I hear."</p>

<p>"He may be wanted above," whispered the Meerza. "Let him
follow me, and without notice or hindrance. Some exorcism is
needed&mdash;you understand&mdash;within&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The man stared, and only bowed assent over his crossed arms.
"Who dared question royal secrets?"</p>

<p>"Coming, Meer Sahib; I only looked for my shoes," cried the
Meerza to his companion, who had advanced a few paces.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>Hearing the secretary's voice, several persons emerged from the
guard-room, holding the Fakeer tightly. His face was distinctly
seen in the morning light, and there could be no mistake.</p>

<p>"He is not one of my children," said the Syud, blandly, looking
at the man, and seating himself in his palankeen, which had been
brought up; "some drunken brawler, no doubt, who deserves a
whipping. Send him to the Kótwal, my sons. I am departing,
Meerza Sahib."</p>

<p>"Khôda Hafiz! (God be with you!)" returned the secretary.
"At noon, you remember!"</p>

<p>"Of course, Meerza Sahib, the royal commands are on my head
and eyes. Go on, my sons," and the bearers shuffled along at their
usual pace.</p>

<p>"Shookr Oolla! (thank God!)" ejaculated the secretary, who
had doubts of the priest, as he had of most others. "Who art
thou, fellow?" he added to the prisoner.</p>

<p>"Bid them loose me," said Pahar Singh, for it was he, "and I
will tell thee. Hast thou forgotten so quickly?"</p>

<p>"My lord," said one of the soldiers, "let us turn him out into
the town."</p>

<p>"How he got in here," added another, "no one knows; yet he is
not drunk, and he has done no harm beyond bawling and struggling.
He has the strength of a fiend."</p>

<p>"Loose him, my friends; he is an exorcist, and there has been
some trouble within," replied the secretary. "I must take him into
the presence. He has no arms? Behold the royal seal."</p>

<p>"I have the amulet which shall restore health to the sick," growled
the pretended Fakeer; "it is sorely needed, and time presses. The
planetary conjunction is passing."</p>

<p>"Come, Syn; I will lead thee in," said the secretary, taking his
hand.</p>

<p>"He has no weapons&mdash;we searched him well; but he will answer
no questions," said several men, speaking together.</p>

<p>"Ah, my friends," replied the secretary, gravely, "those who cast
out evil spirits are not to be questioned. Come, Syn, follow me."</p>

<p>The men shrugged their shoulders incredulously. What could it
mean? To all except the Meerza the entry of such a character to
the private apartments at any hour would have been impossible&mdash;but
now, and under the King's seal? How had he entered the
citadel? The guard at the gate had not seen him pass; and this
mystery, with the fact of his having been expected, furnished plentiful
cause of speculation to those who had seized him.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXXVI">CHAPTER XXXVI.</a></h2>


<p>"What is it?" asked the Meerza anxiously, as they passed into the
inner court. "Why hast thou come, Pahar Singh, thus early?"</p>

<p>"Is he above&mdash;Ali Adil Shah?" asked the robber; "what I have
to say is for him alone. And thou hast recognized me, O Meerza?"</p>

<p>"He is," replied the Meerza; "follow me and be silent. I will
tell him. Yes, I knew thee, and he trusts thee."</p>

<p>The eunuchs of the lower guard bowed their heads on their
folded arms as the two men passed and ascended the stair together.
When they reached the terrace, the Meerza stepped on and drew
aside the curtain.</p>

<p>"He is come, my lord," he said in a low tone&mdash;"he&mdash;the robber."</p>

<p>"I thought so," replied the King; "bring him in."</p>

<p>As Pahar Singh entered, the light of the lamp shone full on him,
and revealed a haggard anxious face; his large eyes were gleaming
wildly from among the heavy masses of his matted hair, now
hanging about his shoulders; but the disguise as a Mahomedan
mendicant was as complete as that of the Hindu Jogi had been.
He made no lowly reverence, but advanced boldly&mdash;defiantly, as it
were&mdash;to the edge of the carpet, and the King involuntarily
grasped the hilt of the short sword lying beside him.</p>

<p>"The King might kill me," said the man, observing the action;
"a word, and the head of Pahar Singh is struck from his body by
those eunuchs yonder. There is no escape hence&mdash;is it not so?
Yet I have trusted thee, O King, and do not fear thee, even as thou
didst not fear me. I am here, true to thy salt; and what I have to
tell thee is as true as I am."</p>

<p>"Fear not," said the King, "and speak freely; thou art safe here."</p>

<p>"Does he know all?" asked the robber, pointing to the Meerza.</p>

<p>"All, friend. Was he not with me, and are not these the letters?"
returned the King. "Else&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I believe thee, Adil Khan," said Pahar Singh. "Now, listen:
time is short, and much has to be done ere thou art safe."</p>

<p>The King started. "Safe?" he cried.</p>

<p>"Ay, safe, my lord. Khan Mahomed was at Almella yesterday,
and is on his way hither now. He will be here about the third
watch of the day, or sooner. What brings him, think you?" said
Pahar Singh, rapidly.</p>

<p>"I sent him a letter of assurance, and he believes it," said the
King.</p>

<p>"Believes it, King? He?" exclaimed the man derisively. "He?
Thou art but a simple boy to think so. No, he has understood it
rightly, and in reply has brought some hundreds of my men with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
him. What for?&mdash;it is in thine eyes to ask&mdash;what for? I will tell
thee. Ah! thy heart tells thee now: there is no need for me to
speak."</p>

<p>"Then his designs are evil, friend," said the King, with a slight
shudder.</p>

<p>"King! without that letter he was not to be trusted. After he
received it he knew his fate," returned Pahar Singh. "We&mdash;I&mdash;have
an evil reputation, they say: and he believed I would do anything
for money. He sent an express messenger for me from
Nuldroog. I had come here with those letters, but my son went.
Money was offered to him: rank&mdash;an estate&mdash;whatever he pleased.
Money? yea, much money. A lakh of rupees&mdash;more. Why? thou
already knowest. Yes&mdash;to kill thee, O Adil Khan, thou wert not
to live over to-day. My son pleaded fatigue and my absence&mdash;time
also to collect the men. That is why Khan Mahomed did not
arrive yesterday. That is why he is at Almella now. My son is
shrewd and wise&mdash;he secured all he could of the Wuzeer's money;
and then&mdash;ah, blessed boy!&mdash;he rode on to meet me last night.
Ha, ha! they thought he had gone to Itga to hurry on the men;
but he is a good youth&mdash;he knew what to do. A gallant horse is
that which that Lalla left with us; thy life was on its feet, O
Prince! and my boy was in sore temptation. So he reached me
last night, just as I had gained my hiding-place, of which he knew.
Ah, I was sick at heart, for my brother was dead&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dead!" cried the secretary; "God forbid! he was with thee,
and well."</p>

<p>"Ay, dead, Meerza," continued Pahar Singh. "Yes, murdered&mdash;perish
the cowardly hand that struck the blow in the dark. We
were attacked by robbers, who had watched us, and he was struck
down in the fight. I went for assistance to carry him, and when I
returned he was dead, and a knife-wound in his heart. Enough,
master," continued Pahar Singh, dashing his hand roughly across
his eyes. "He died in thy service. Enough for him."</p>

<p>"And then?" asked the King.</p>

<p>"My son had consented to do the work; and that slave, the
Wuzeer, believed him. The boy told me he pretended to hate the
King, and that there was a death feud between our house and
thine, Adil Khan&mdash;was it not good? O, he is a clever youth
that. It was he who got those letters, too: and now he has received
money from the slave. Enough! Speak, O King. Is the
slave to be delivered into thy hand alive, or wilt thou give him to
me&mdash;to me, Pahar Singh? Dost thou doubt me? I ask no money&mdash;no
reward from thee. Thy house&mdash;thy very life&mdash;is in peril:
Pahar Singh can save both, and ask nothing but to be held true to
his master's salt. Nay, do not interrupt me," he continued, waving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
his hand, while he wiped away the foam which, in his excitement,
had gathered on his lips. "Think, Adil Khan, was thy royal house
ever so threatened before? Hath not the Wuzeer prepared the
enemy to make his last swoop upon thee, even as a falcon on a
hare; and wert thou dead, with no son to rally men around him,
and Khan Mahomed holding the power,&mdash;could thy kingdom be
preserved? Are the Moghuls idle? Is Sivaji Bhóslay indifferent?
Above all, could thy royal armies have saved thee had I been a
traitor?"</p>

<p>"Come hither," cried Adil Shah, from whose eyes the tears were
welling fast as he thought upon his defenceless state, the deep
treachery which had been meditated, and the rough earnest devotion
of this strange man. "Come hither: let me put my hand on
thy head."</p>

<p>Pahar Singh advanced. The squalid mendicant covered with
rags&mdash;to all appearance what he seemed, so complete was the disguise&mdash;trod
boldly upon the royal bed of satin and velvet; but he
bowed his head to meet the hand which the King extended and laid
upon it gently.</p>

<p>"As thou wilt, true servant," said the King, "for there is a stern
and fearful necessity to be encountered. Whatever reward thou
mayst claim hereafter is freely bestowed upon thee&mdash;all thou
hast ever done against me or my people is forgiven. Take that
slave for thine own if thou wilt, to deal with as it seemeth good to
thee."</p>

<p>"Remember," cried Pahar Singh, seizing the King's hand and
detaining it upon his head, "these words cannot be revoked. Whatever
happens, I do but thy bidding, O King; and, only for the need
for thee to know it, I had done the same even though I had not
seen thee. Now I go, whither ye cannot trace me, but ye will hear
of me ere the day is past."</p>

<p>"Go," replied the King. "I have no fear of thee or of thine acts.
Alla and the Prophet direct and keep thee, O true friend, whom he
hath sent me in my need. Go!"</p>

<p>"Only be careful," continued the man, withdrawing the King's
hand from his head, kissing it reverently, and then releasing it&mdash;"only
be careful! Stir not beyond the fort till the news comes
to thee. The guards on the gates and within are of the true party,
and thou art safe with them. Care not for revolt; the Wuzeer
brings no men with him but my own. My son prevented those he
brought from coming on, and they returned to Nuldroog from
Almella. None of his party here dare stir. Yet, if there be any
movement, send for Afzool Khan and his son Fazil; they are my
bitter enemies, but they are true to thee. Nay more, the Wuzeer's
son is not with his father in this matter, and is true to thee,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
O King, because of the young Fazil. And now I go. Send me
beyond the gate, for I must not depart as I came."</p>

<p>"I am ready to go," said the secretary. "They were marvelling
at thy sudden appearance. How was it?"</p>

<p>"I may tell thee some time or other," returned Pahar Singh,
smiling; "but come, it is almost day. Yet, ere I depart, my lord, I
would kiss thy feet. The reverence I once paid thy father, the
noble Sultan Mahmood, I would pay to thee." And so saying, he
prostrated himself, embracing the King's feet, and kissing them
respectfully.</p>

<p>"Would thou wert a true believer, and thou wouldst be as a
brother. O, that I could reward thee adequately," said the King,
with much emotion.</p>

<p>"I am better as I am&mdash;free," returned Pahar Singh. "When I
have earned reward, Adil Khan, I may ask it if I live; and if I die,
remember there was one true heart among thy people, and protect
my Gopal&mdash;my son. Let us not speak of reward; there is nothing
now between us but true faith, as thou art witness, O Meerza, and
that faith was never yet given for gold."</p>

<p>So saying, he turned and passed rapidly through the curtain,
followed by the secretary.</p>

<p>Was there any doubt in the young King's mind now? None; all
was clear. There was no thought of mercy&mdash;none of receding from
determination. There could be no question of Pahar Singh's story,
else why had he, outlaw and robber as he was, trusted himself in
the very palace? There was no appearance about that strange man
which could lead to a suspicion of deceit, and his grim devotion in
this emergency affected the King deeply. Even if Pahar Singh
failed, the course was clear. The Wuzeer must be confronted with
the silent witnesses of his treachery; and in Afzool Khan and a score
of other trusty adherents, the King felt he had ample protection.</p>

<p>No; it was no deception. After a short interval of silence, the
Fakeer's cry, "Ulla dilâyâ to léonga!" again arose more sonorously,
more confidently than before, and the King, stepping out on the
terrace, listened, speculating how far the man might be gone on his
deadly errand, and what would come of it, so absorbedly, that the
secretary's footsteps, as he ascended the stair, were not heard, and
the King started as he spoke once more.</p>

<p>"He is gone, my lord, on his work. I saw him pass beyond the
gate."</p>

<p>"Did he say aught?"</p>

<p>"Nothing&mdash;he did not speak again. As he passed out of the
court he shouted his cry, and continued it, walking rapidly till he
was beyond the bridge of the ditch. Many of the men saluted him,
and some offered alms, but he answered no one, and, still shouting,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
pressed on so quickly that I could hardly follow. When I last saw
him, he had turned by the 'Goruk Imlee' tree, and was running
fast; and so God speed him!"</p>

<p>"Ameen!" sighed the King. "Thou must not leave me to-day,
Anwur Ali. Order a Durbar at noon, and there will we await the
end. He or I, Meerza, whichever God wills; but it shall not be said
of Adil Khan that he shrank from his fate into his zenana. Go;
sleep there on my cushions for a while; we both need rest," and by
another doorway, the King passed to the inner apartments.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXXVII">CHAPTER XXXVII.</a></h2>


<p>The day wore on; and it may be imagined that the anxieties of the
lady Lurlee and the fair Zyna were not diminished by the continued
absence of the Khan and his son. As the former had left his wife,
he had requested her to have a "kichéri" of a particular kind, with
kabobs, prepared for him when he arrived. "He should be hungry,"
he said, "after his ride so early, and Fazil too. It was a soldier's
dish, and would put him in mind of old days in the field, and&mdash;Lurlee
could dress it so capitally." We may remember a slight
bandying of words between the Khan and his lady before he went
out; and he had ordered this dish as a propitiatory meal at her hands,
for he knew by experience that the result would be satisfactory: the
little acerbity would disappear, and the planets, perhaps, would be
forgotten.</p>

<p>Nothing could have been devised more soothing to the lady
Lurlee's temper&mdash;nothing more certain of dispelling any clouds of
dissatisfaction or disappointment&mdash;than this appeal to her affections
through her kitchen. Even in these intellectual days, a similar result
is not unfrequently attainable; proving that the motives and
springs of poor human nature, and its tempers, show but little difference
at the time of our history and among ourselves; and did we
permit ourselves to moralize after the fashion of the day, we might
possibly deliver a pretty lecture upon the subject.</p>

<p>But&mdash;and we may as well avow it once for all&mdash;we feel ourselves
bound to relate our story without any moralizing digressions whatever,
further than what may form part of its action; and therefore
we will not follow the changes of the lady's mind, from its first expectant
and interested condition after the mixing of the materials by
her own fair hands (for on such occasions she suffered no one to
interfere), to the setting them on the fire to be done exactly as her
lord wished. With the Khan's loving order, had come a flood of
pleasant memories to her&mdash;of old camp days, hard fights too, in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
her lord&mdash;safe, generally victorious, and restored to her prayers&mdash;found
his wife busy with some favourite dish; and they loved each
other, in a homely fashion, better for the cooking and the eating of it.</p>

<p>Now, as the lady sat over her private brazier, on which were her
own silver cooking-vessels, the Khan's special gift, she told Zyna of
many an old time and scene&mdash;of many a narrow escape&mdash;many a
rough march which she had shared with the old soldier, and done her
part in binding up his wounds if he were hurt, or cooking for him if
he were hungry.</p>

<p>"Your mother was not of our rough Dekhani sort, daughter," she
said; "people tell me she never went out with the army: she was a
weak, fragile thing, I have heard, but very beautiful. Peace be with
her, for thy father loved her much, and hath never loved me as her.
But no children have come, Zyna&mdash;no children, that is it,"&mdash;and the
lady sighed, and perhaps tears gathered in her eyes, for she wiped
them hastily with the corner of her muslin scarf. "Well, it is God's
will, daughter; and though I could never understand it properly,
there was something wrong in the horoscope which they cast when
I was betrothed. You see, Zyna, my planet was then Mars, which
represented water&mdash;no, it was fire;&mdash;no, that's a male planet, and so
it must have been Earth. Yes, I think it was&mdash;Earth; and then he
was Venus&mdash;no, that could not be either; it must have been Saturn,
and that's for air. So you see, fire and air&mdash;no, let me see&mdash;air and
water? no. What did I tell thee, Zyna? Was it Earth?"</p>

<p>"I do not understand it, mother; how can I tell?" said Zyna
demurely.</p>

<p>"But you are not listening, girl; ah, wait till your own time comes.
I'll warrant you anxious and curious enough to know whether you
are fire or earth, or air or water; and whether he is air, or water, or
whatever he may be. Now about myself. You see I was fire; no
I am wrong. 'Humul,' 'Sowr,' 'Jowza' (Aries, Taurus, Gemini),"
continued the lady Lurlee, telling off all the signs of the zodiac, in
Arabic, upon the ends of her fingers, and then the planets in succession,
"'Mars,' 'Venus,' 'Mercury;' and now look, Zyna, if the house
of the Lion is on this middle finger, and the planet Mercury comes to
it, you see Mercury is in conjunction with&mdash;with the Crab. Did not
I say the Crab, child? Now attend, else I shall lose all my reckoning.
'Humul,' 'Sowr'&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Alas, mother, but I do not understand it, and I can never remember
the names of the planets or their houses,&mdash;indeed I cannot,"
said Zyna, piteously. "But ah, mother, look, it is burning!"</p>

<p>And so it was. In her astrological involvement, Lurlee Khánum
had forgotten the kichéri, which, as the bottom of the pan became
too hot, sent up a most unsavoury odour, and brown smoke issued
from under the lid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>"God forgive me my neglect, daughter," exclaimed the lady,
sorrowfully, as she examined the pan: "it is surely quite spoiled, and
thy father is so particular. The least idea of burnt kichéri is enough
to set him mad, and I could not look at him for a day or more. And
he will be expecting this to be all ready." "Protection of the Prophet!"
exclaimed the lady suddenly, "there he is. What shall I
do?&mdash;what shall I do?"</p>

<p>That which had startled Lurlee was the arrival of the Khan's
escort, and the beating of their kettle-drums in the outer court; and
as she listened, and stood up, ladle in hand, expecting her lord's
entrance, she was perhaps relieved by the appearance of Goolab who,
as the general outdoor scout, brought tidings from the courtyard of
occurrences of all kinds.</p>

<p>"They are not coming, lady," said the nurse. "They are gone to
the Kótwal's, and will stay there. That's the news brought by Peer
Khan, and a host of them. And there's Bulwunt Rao as good as
dead; and he's to be put into the private apartments, and the King's
doctor is to be sent for; and I must go and see to a bed for him, and
a soft mattress, and pillows and sheets; and then they'll all be spoilt
with his blood. His blood, indeed!"</p>

<p>"A blister on thy tongue, O prating woman!" cried Lurlee.
"My lord taken to the Kótwal's? <i>My</i> lord! O Zyna! O girl, what
is the world come to? Thy father taken to that man of blood,
Jehándar Beg; and those cowards, the Paigah, have come here without
him? O girl&mdash;what is it? speak, hast thou no sense?"</p>

<p>Indeed, Zyna had very little; the mention of that dreaded name,
the certainty that if her father could have returned he would, and
the fact of Bulwunt Rao being dangerously wounded, all combined
to terrify, and Lurlee herself was no calmer.</p>

<p>"Was there no message, Goolab?" asked Zyna.</p>

<p>"O yes; that the Khan remains at the Kótwal's, and will eat his
breakfast there. He has business, and will stay. That is all, and
that Meah Sahib is well."</p>

<p>"That is all!" exclaimed Lurlee. "That is all! To have my
lord in the Kótwallee, and that dish of kichéri dressed in vain! O
woman of little grace that I am! why did I deserve this? what have
I done? what have I done?"</p>

<p>"But it was spoiled, mother," said Zyna innocently; "do not care
about it. Only thank God they are safe. O, I vow a Fateha&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not care, child? and would it not have been the same had it
been, as it was, dressed like food for the Peris? would it not have
been the same? Would he have come to eat it? he, thy father?
Why order it? why affront me by leaving it here to be spoiled? why
did he not come long ago? This is not as it used to be of old. O,
Afzool Khan! am I less than dirt in thine eyes? am I&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, the lady Lurlee, like all other Mahomedan ladies, only mentioned
her husband's name on very solemn occasions, or when
excitement got the better of discretion; and here was an instance of
it. She sat down upon the stool before her brazier, and, after rocking
herself to and fro for a while, burst into an uncontrollable fit of
sobbing. It was difficult to say, perhaps, what had most particularly
affected her; but undoubtedly the burning of the kichéri was at the
bottom of all. It had been so good. Then she knew how his face
would have expanded under its influence as he ate; it would have
reminded him of some old scene, whose history would have come out
between the mouthfuls&mdash;he might even have caressed her. Ah, all
was now gone&mdash;her trouble, her expectation of a loving greeting, all
gone: and the sense of neglect and indifference under which she
habitually existed, had for the time taken its place. But gradually
the sobbing was soothed, and Lurlee, laying her head against Zyna's
bosom, seemed lost in thought.</p>

<p>"There must be unfavourable conjunctions among the planets to-day,
depend upon it, daughter," she said at length, rousing herself,
and drying her eyes, "else all this would not have happened. Now,
let me look steadily into it: perhaps we may learn something for our
guidance."</p>

<p>"Look!" continued the lady after a pause, and a brief examination
of an astrological table, which she usually carried about her,
"look here. Ah, graceless and unfortunate that I am, I should have
foreseen all that has happened, and he should never have gone out at
all. Why, here is Saturn in the ascendant till the first watch of the day,
and then follows the Sun, and that's what spoilt my cooking. Let
me see&mdash;Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer," she continued, counting
the signs of the zodiac, as before, on her fingers, "Aries, Taurus&mdash;why,
God be merciful! here follows Mars, and he's an executioner&mdash;and
they are in the Kótwallee&mdash;the Prophet's mercy be on them!
Yet, stay, Mars will last for only three hours; then comes, let me
see&mdash;Mars, Jupiter, Mercury, Moon&mdash;no, Venus, Jupiter, Moon. Yes,
I am right now, girl. That means messenger, and Venus is propitious.
Ah, yes, don't you see it all, Zyna? Don't you understand? Look,
first the Moon, that's we ourselves, as messengers; and then Venus
will save them, if we can get past Mars. Of course it is quite plain.
Don't you see?"</p>

<p>"Alas, no, mother! I do not," said Zyna, innocently. "I see
figures and numbers, and angles and signs, but it is hopeless to ask
me about them. You are a wise woman, and this is a marvellous
science. Surely, and please God, you are right."</p>

<p>"O, I see exactly what to do; and it is well I can pick out a path
among these mysteries," cried Lurlee, brightening, "or we had all
been lost long ago. But we will eat first; I am sure some of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
kichéri is good, and at any rate there are the kabobs, and Jameela
will have bread. Come and eat, daughter, it will support thee; come,
we have much to do ere noon. I see now, and when thou hast eaten I
will tell thee. Jameela! O Jameela!" she cried to the cook, who, when
her mistress came to usurp her functions, discreetly kept out of the
way. "Jameela, bring some bread and some pickle; we must eat now."</p>

<p>"But you have the kichéri," said the dame. "Surely it is not
burnt," she continued, sniffing into the pan with a cook's experienced
nose.</p>

<p>"Begone, graceless!" cried Lurlee, who well knew the old woman
was rejoicing in her heart over her discomfiture; "begone and get
the bread."</p>

<p>"There is none but the men's bread, and it is coarse enough, for
the meal was not sifted," returned Jameela. "When <i>you</i> take to
cooking, of course I am not expected to be mindful of other light
bread, and such things; but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Begone, and do as you are bid," cried her mistress, sharply. A
look from Zyna also, deprecating further discussion, was understood
at once by the old dame.</p>

<p>"I will bring the best of it, Khánum," she said, "and there is
some quite hot; but I can bake a few of your own 'phoolkas,' if you
like; they will be good with the kabobs ... which seem savoury,"
she continued, craning over to look into the pot on the fire, and
sniffing into it.</p>

<p>"Where is Goolab? Ah yes, do so, Jameela, and bring them
quickly," replied her mistress; "thou art a jewel."</p>

<p>"I will send her, lady," said the cook, departing; "and I would
bring the men's bread, only it is not fit for the likes of ye."</p>

<p>"Now, what is to be done?" asked Zyna. "O mother, thou
seemest to understand everything, and art confident, and I am distracted
with apprehension. O my father! O my brother! God keep
you safe. I vow lights at Peer Sahib's tomb, and to feed a hundred
Fakeers there to-morrow, if they be safe!"</p>

<p>"We must go to the palace, and inquire why thy father is detained,"
replied Lurlee decisively. "Ah, Goolab, where wert thou? But never
mind," she continued, as the dame entered. "Lay out clothes for
us; we must go to the palace; and bid some one go and say we pray
to see the Bégum Sahiba, and order the palankeens and an escort to
be ready. Inshalla! daughter, we will see what this evil-minded
and base-born Kótwal can do."</p>

<p>"And the jewels, Khánum?" asked Goolab.</p>

<p>"Ah! I had forgotten. Well, a few."</p>

<p>"No, mother, no!" cried Zyna, "not so. With our hearts heavy
and sad, it surely is no time to put on jewels. Let us rather go with
sober garments, and prostrate ourselves before the Peer's shrine on
our way."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>"I tell thee the Peer cannot help us," returned the dame tartly;
"it is the stars and the Bégum. When they are safe, then do thy
Fateha if thou wilt. Come here, eat, for we have much to do. Ah!
Jameela-bee;" for Lurlee always added the respectful addition of
<i>bee</i>, for lady,&mdash;when she was in good humour, to her cook, who now
entered with a tray of hot bread and delicate phoolkas, and a white
cloth over her arm: "thou hast been quick, friend."</p>

<p>It must be confessed that the lady Lurlee's appetite, sharpened perhaps
by her unusual fast and the process of her own cookery, did ample
justice to the meal. Her confidence in the stars sustained her far
better than Zyna's faith in her saint&mdash;that is, if one might judge by
the resolute and satisfied features of the elder face as it bent over its
plate, eating heartily, and the distressed, anxious, and tearful expression
of the younger, endeavouring almost vainly to eat at all. It
was of no avail that Lurlee encouraged her daughter, and even picked
out tempting morsels from the kabobs, and set them before her, with
the hottest of the phoolkas, as they were sent in short relays from
the kitchen.</p>

<p>"Ah, daughter! he would have enjoyed this," said Lurlee, as she
washed her hands over the ewer brought her at the conclusion of the
meal, and sighed in a manner which plainly signified her regret not
to be able to eat more. "Yes, the kabob was good, but thou hast
scarcely tasted it; a trifle more pepper would have been better, perhaps;
yet it was good. And now, girl, I am ready to face the
Kótwal or the Bégum, or&mdash;the peace of God be on him&mdash;Adil Shah
himself. Inshalla! we will see who dares to detain my lord when I,
Lurlee Khánum, have cooked his breakfast."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXXVIII">CHAPTER XXXVIII.</a></h2>


<p>Enough had transpired in the examination of Afzool Khan and his
son, to satisfy Jehándar Beg that the young man and his father had
attained knowledge of some secret relating to the conspiracies in
progress, which they were reserving to tell the King; and we should
be doing that very astute officer injustice, if we did not at once admit
that he believed the secret known to them, or at least to Fazil, concerned
the Wuzeer very deeply. Why the King's secretary had been
mentioned he could not imagine. Did he know it also? Certainly
it was important to find out everything that could be discovered,
previous to the Wuzeer's arrival; and he purposed himself to go to
his house, and have speech of him, before he should attend the Durbar,
and appear before the King to inform him of the detention of
Afzool Khan and his son, and of the events connected with them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>But Jehándar Beg, as police minister of that large city, had other
sources of information; and whatever occurred at night was reported
to him by his spies before the true business of the day commenced.
Had not Afzool Khan come direct to the court, it is most probable
that Jehándar Beg would have heard some account of Fazil Khan's
night adventure before he appeared at all. As it was, there had been
a reversion of events: and we must now follow the magistrate briefly,
in his reception of the spies whom he summoned, directly the door
of the court had closed upon the Khan and his son.</p>

<p>The room in which these persons were received, was one which
could be entered from the large hall of audience: but there was a
door also by the back passage which led from a street behind, and
persons could come and go unobserved. There was nothing in this
chamber&mdash;which indeed was very small&mdash;but a large pillow and a
carpet, on which the Kótwal's sword-dagger, a heavy-bladed Persian
or Affghan knife, and writing materials, were placed. As he sat down
and clapped his hands, a door opposite was opened by a slave without,
and a Brahmun, as was evident by his dress and the caste marks
on his forehead, was admitted.</p>

<p>"Be seated," said Jehándar Beg. "Have you anything for me
to-day, Pundit?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered the Brahmun, taking a pair of spectacles from a
fold in his turban, and placing them across his nose, and then producing
some papers from a pocket within his dress; "these have
just arrived by a special messenger from Moro Trimmul at Tooljapoor;"
and he handed to the Kótwal several letters sealed with
the private Mahratta seal of Sivaji Bhóslay, which Jehándar Beg
examined closely; then, apparently satisfied, he made a Persian
memorandum on the corner of each, with the date of receipt, very
methodically, and put them into the side-pocket of his robe.</p>

<p>"And," continued the Brahmun, looking over his letter as the
Kótwal had finished, "Moro Trimmul writes that his sister has been
married to a Shastree at Tooljapoor, and that he has not been idle;
but he cannot induce Pahar Singh to visit him or accept terms, and
he is afraid to go to Itga himself; so it were better your worship
advised our master to treat with him."</p>

<p>"Very good; I will mention it," returned the Kótwal; "but has
Moro Trimmul been to Nuldroog to see the Wuzeer? It is not far."</p>

<p>"No, my lord; he was afraid to go unless a 'Kowl' were sent to
him."</p>

<p>"Curious that, O Pundit!" added Jehándar Beg, with a sneer;
"he is not scrupulous in general, I think."</p>

<p>"No, not in general, perhaps," replied the man; "but in this case
he is&mdash;he is&mdash;not sure."</p>

<p>"Not sure? Well, I suppose he is certain of my being able to apprehend
him, and make him so, on the Goruk Imlee tree."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>"My lord is all-powerful; but Moro is careful&mdash;as much so as
Sivaji Bhóslay or Tannajee Maloosray," returned the Pundit, dryly.</p>

<p>"Ah yes; no doubt, friend; he thinks himself so," replied Jehándar
Beg, with a sneer; "but what of Tannajee himself? I heard
just now that he is here, and was seen last night."</p>

<p>"Tannajee is everywhere," returned the man, smiling, "or some
one else for him. If my lord requires him, he may be found at
Wye: he would not trust himself in Beejapoor, I think; yet&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why not, Pundit?"</p>

<p>"My lord can best answer that. Like Moro Trimmul, he is better
at a distance till the time comes. He does not like 'those trees' of
my lord's."</p>

<p>For once the Kótwal was at fault. It was necessary to gain over
the Mahratta interest, else the intrigue with the Emperor were
abortive; but it was clear none of the Mahratta agents would trust
the Wuzeer's party, without more assurance of its success than at
present appeared likely; and the Kótwal felt this keenly. He might
threaten, imprison, or even torture, but he could not penetrate beyond
the surface.</p>

<p>"Tannajee was in the kullal's bazar last night," said Jehándar
Beg, after a pause, "and had a narrow escape. He ought not to
place himself in such peril."</p>

<p>"Indeed! I have said before there are Maloosrays everywhere,"
returned the Brahmun dryly; "I know what has been told you,
my lord; but," he added, smiling, "I suppose you don't believe it."</p>

<p>"That is as may be proved hereafter. We shall know more by-and-by&mdash;to-day,
perhaps," replied Jehándar Beg.</p>

<p>The man shrugged his shoulders. "Does my lord wish me to
stay?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Not particularly. The master comes this afternoon, and may
wish to see you."</p>

<p>"Certainly, I will attend; but about Maloosray? If he comes I
will tell you," continued the Pundit, laughing; "but do not listen,
my lord, to idle stories; Maloosray is everywhere, and in that is his
safety. May I go?"</p>

<p>"Yes, go;" and the man, making a respectful salute, departed.</p>

<p>The Pundit was a clever agent, deeply devoted, like all his
countrymen, to the Mahratta interest, apparently serving the Wuzeer's
party through Jehándar Beg, yet at the same time revealing only
what was advisable to be known, and gaining all the information he
could. He had already seen Maloosray, and went direct to Jehándar
Beg, on purpose to mislead him, in which he perfectly succeeded.</p>

<p>The Kótwal sat and mused a while on what had been told him.
He believed the Brahmun about Maloosray. "And Pahar Singh
would not join them? That is all he knows," said Jehándar Beg<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
to himself. "My lord writes that he is sure of the robber, and
brings some of his men with him. What can that be for?" He
felt as though he had not been quite trusted; still the Wuzeer was
coming that day, and would tell all. He could not perhaps write.</p>

<p>So another spy was admitted, evidently one of the royal eunuchs.
He sat down where the Brahmun had been seated, and for a time
was silent.</p>

<p>"Well," said Jehándar Beg, "is thy brain heavy with drink, Mahmood,
or with secrets? Or is there bad news? Why art thou silent?"</p>

<p>"Good or bad, I know not, my lord," replied the man; "but it is
at least curious, and you may understand it. I do not."</p>

<p>"Indeed!&mdash;say on, friend," returned the Kótwal, settling himself
into an attitude of attention.</p>

<p>"My lord the secretary," said the man calmly, "was out late last
night. He went to a temple somewhere, and there was another with
him. He then returned to the palace, and the Peer Zadah and
Neelkunt Rai were sent for and admitted. They sat till nearly dawn,
when a Fakeer came, and was taken up to the Palace of the Seven
Stories by the secretary."</p>

<p>Jehándar Beg took his beard in his hand, rubbed and stroked it,
and mused for several minutes. "Anything more?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Some money was taken," added the man. "That is all I know,
except that a Durbar is ordered after the mid-day prayer."</p>

<p>These tidings, strange as they seemed to be, troubled Jehándar
Beg sorely. He had not been told of the Durbar. What could have
happened? "Thou must go and find out who was with the secretary,"
he said.</p>

<p>"If I might speak," said the spy timidly, looking about him&mdash;"I
think it was&mdash;" and he advanced and whispered in the Kótwal's ear&mdash;"the
King himself."</p>

<p>"The King? Impossible; he never left the palace," returned the
Kótwal, aloud. "I know that he did not. The King?&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My lord cannot be mistaken," replied the spy, deferentially.
"Nevertheless, I heard it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Quite impossible! He could not have gone without my knowing
of it, Mahmood; nor dare he venture out without being attended.
Who were with the secretary?"</p>

<p>"Bundagee Sahib, and five others only; and the man who went
with the secretary entered the private apartments with him when
they returned. This I saw, for I was watching."</p>

<p>"Thou shouldst have gone into the court with them," said the
Kótwal. "What neglect is this?"</p>

<p>"I was going, but the guard stopped me," said the spy, as if
ashamed. "They knew me, and turned me out of the fort-gate.
What could I do? Since the last time I was drunk, they will not
admit me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>"And the Fakeer?"</p>

<p>"I heard him calling inside, 'Ulla dilâyâ to léonga;' and when he
got outside he ran, still shouting, towards the Goruk Imlee trees, and
I lost sight of him."</p>

<p>"Then who told you he went into the palace?"</p>

<p>"O, the men on guard said one of the ladies had seen demons,
and that the Syn had been sent for, to say incantations over her."</p>

<p>"Very likely," said the Kótwal, calmly. "Now go and bring me the
news I want. Was it the King who went with the Meerza, or his own
son? Find this out for me, and return directly."</p>

<p>"Jo hookum!" returned the spy, "your slave will do his best,"
and he departed.</p>

<p>We need not follow Jehándar Beg in his other private audiences.
He had many spies over many people.</p>

<p>If he had not been delayed by these communications and his own
meditations upon them, and had gone to his prisoners at once, it is
possible, perhaps, that the Khan and his son might have been taken
by surprise; but they had been warned, and were prepared for him.</p>

<p>The lad Ashruf, who has been already mentioned, had been
present during the first examination. No one noticed him; but he
was shrewd and observant. He had asked his father whether he
should run and bring down the whole force of Afzool Khan's Paigah
to rescue the Khan; and perhaps the boy would have enjoyed a share
in the mêlee which would undoubtedly have followed; but his father,
while checking him angrily for the thought, bid him be on the watch,
and should there be any danger, to give information of it. So the
lad had remained in the Kuchéri, and was not noticed among the
soldiers who lounged about there. As the Kótwal entered his private
room, and was known to be generally occupied for some time, the
various clerks and scribes took advantage of his absence, and had
for the most part gone out; a few only remained, who seemed
absorbed in their business. So, gradually, the lad edged himself
close to the private door, which, as sometimes happens in Indian
houses, did not close completely, on account of the hinges being outside
the door-post. The lad could not see, but he could hear if he
placed his ear, carelessly, to all appearance, against the place where
the door joined the door-frame, and in this attitude he was not disturbed.
Being questioned by a soldier, he answered lazily, that he
was ordered to wait for his father's return; and apparently was
settling quietly to sleep, leaning against the wall.</p>

<p>Ashruf had no idea at first of the results of the position in which
he had placed himself; but a few words awakened his attention
perfectly. To hear better also, he feigned to be sleepy, drew a part
of his scarf over his face, and lay down; and by this means he could
see under the door sufficiently to observe who came.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>The Brahmun's communication did not interest him much; but
as soon as the eunuch was seated, whom he knew to be in disgrace
for habitual intemperance, he felt sure that his tidings would relate
to the palace, and he listened more carefully than ever. Very little
escaped him. He could not hear the eunuch's whisper, but the
Kótwal had repeated the name of the King aloud&mdash;that was enough.
It was necessary, at least, that the young Khan should know of it,
and directly the eunuch had been dismissed, the lad got up and
looked about.</p>

<p>It is frequently the case that, in houses of one floor only, like this,
a staircase leads from the principal room to the roof; and in the
corner, not far from the door we have mentioned, was one of this
description. Ashruf watched his opportunity, and when no one was
observing him, slipped gently behind the wall at the entrance of the
steps, and ascended them quickly. He had remarked the direction
of the court where Afzool Khan and his son were detained, and,
creeping on his hands and knees to the edge of the terrace, looked
into it.</p>

<p>At first he did not see them, because they were sitting upon the
same side under one of the arches; but a soft cry of "Huzrut!
Huzrut!" ("My prince! my prince!") in a voice very like a
woman's, and a small piece of plaster thrown into the court, induced
Fazil to get up and attend to the signal, whatever it might be.
Looking up, he saw the lad's face peeping through an aperture in
the open stucco-work of the parapet, and in a few moments had heard
what he had to tell. It was important, because putting them on
their guard against further questioning, which could only have one
object, their continued detention; and thoughtful, because proving
a faithful interest, which Fazil trusted to reward. It confirmed also,
suspicions of the connection between the Wuzeer and the Kótwal.</p>

<p>"Can I do anything more, noble sir?" asked the boy, when his
little story was done; "be quick, else I may be seen and flogged."</p>

<p>"Yes, two things," replied Fazil; "first, run to Kowas Khan, the
Wuzeer's son; bid him come to me here well attended, but with no
appearance of force; and then go to the Lurlee Khánum, at our
house, with those papers"&mdash;and he threw what he had to him&mdash;"and
tell her we shall not be at home early, as we have to attend the
King's Durbar, and that we are well. She is to keep the papers till
we come."</p>

<p>They saw the boy's face disappear, and heard him crawling back
over the terrace. Fortunately he had not been observed, and he
gained the bottom of the steps safely, and passed out among the
soldiers, unchallenged, on his double mission.</p>

<p>But while he is running at a steady, unvarying trot, not staying
even to take breath, we must follow what the Kótwal had to say to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
the old Khan and his son, which may be of importance in the elucidation
of this history.</p>

<p>"Fear not, my father," said Fazil to him, as voices were heard at
the door, "fear not, all will be well. The boy will do as he was told;
and without alarm or force of any kind we shall be soon free. But
speak not, let me talk; you are to know nothing, but that you went
to fetch me when I sent for you last night."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXXIX">CHAPTER XXXIX.</a></h2>


<p>"Lady," said Goolab, again entering suddenly, "there is a boy in the
court who says he must have instant speech of you. He will tell no
one what he has to say, except that he has come from the master."</p>

<p>"A boy, Goolab? how old is he? can I see him? Quick,
woman, my veil&mdash;anything to cover me," exclaimed Lurlee.</p>

<p>"Take this, mother," said Zyna, unfastening her scarf; "what
need of concealment with a boy? I will go aside. Admit him,
Goolab; he may have news of them."</p>

<p>The lad entered and prostrated himself before the Khánum.
"Take these papers," he said. "My lord the Khan hath sent them;
you are to keep them, and no one is to see them. He and his son
are well and safe, and will go to the King in the afternoon."</p>

<p>"Prophet of God, what is this?" cried Lurlee. "Mahratta, too?
Well, no one shall take them from me;" and, so saying, she stuffed
them into that most convenient and unapproachable of all lady's
hiding-places, her bodice.</p>

<p>"I am going, lady," said the lad, who had observed the action;
"they are safe with thee now."</p>

<p>"Not before thou hast eaten, boy. There is some kichéri ready"&mdash;he
will not mind its being burnt, she thought&mdash;"thou must be
hungry."</p>

<p>Ashruf was, to say the truth, hungry enough; but he resisted
temptation. "No, lady, let me go," he said; "I have another errand
for my lord. May your house prosper."</p>

<p>"Thou art right," returned Lurlee, as he saluted her and departed.
"Go; God speed thee; thou art a good lad. And now, Zyna, let us
attire ourselves in fitting garments, and go to the palace, for time
presses, and it is already past noon."</p>

<p>This, however, promised to be no easy task; and if Lurlee Khánum
had had time to consult her tables in a fitting manner, the colour
and particular kind of garment which would suit that period of the
day, and in which the wearer would be lucky or unlucky, must have
been decided. Goolab, too, and the other women, to whom the idea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
of the ladies going to the palace could be no other than an occasion
for the display of the utmost magnificence, had laid out costly dresses
of cloth-of-gold, brocade, muslin, satin; and a petticoat of gorgeous
purple Italian velvet, trimmed with broad silver ribbon, with purple
flowers upon it, a recent acquisition to the wardrobe, was especially
tempting.</p>

<p>"Pardon me, Khánum," said Kurreem-bee, the "Moghulanee," or
household dressmaker and mistress of the robes, "but on an occasion
of this kind, and when a petition is to be made, we should know
something of the mood her highness the Bégum is in, and the garments
should agree with it. Yellow or red, with gold or silver,
might excite bile&mdash;blue or purple would create phlegm; and when
my lady Chand-bee, the wife of J&#257;nee Sahib D&#257;gtoray, went to
visit&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Now, in the Prophet's name, cease, Kurreem-bee!" cried Lurlee,
interrupting her; "are we not in haste? and thou standest prating
about Chand-bee, who never could dress herself except like a public
dancing-girl. Peace, I say. Give me the green satin petticoat laced
with silver, and the plain white scarf with gold flowers; these, with
a shawl, will be enough."</p>

<p>Meanwhile Goolab and some other women-servants had made their
preparations. The old dame was aware that her red satin petticoat,
one of the Khánum's presents, would be much in her way, flapping
about her legs as she ran by the litter; and as the ladies were settling
themselves in their seats, she tucked it up, forming it, as it were,
into a very efficient pair of baggy breeches, reaching to her knees,
which could be shaken out when she arrived at the palace: and at
the same time tied her clean muslin scarf about her waist and
shoulders, in such a manner as to display a considerable amount of
rotundity in directions otherwise perhaps not remarkable.</p>

<p>"Ah, you may laugh, impudence," she cried, aiming a blow at a
fine sturdy lad, who, with others bearing spears, had just entered the
court&mdash;"you may laugh, but that's the way to run;" and she kicked
out first one leg, then the other, by way of proving whether the petticoat
arrangements were firm. "I have run ten coss a-day when my
lord was in the field, and carried my lady's hooka into the bargain.
Peace, impudent knaves!" she continued to the men, as the laugh
against her became more general when the bearers entered. "Take
up the palankeen and let us go. Bismilla!"</p>

<p>There was no time for further colloquy, for the men, who had been
turned out of the court while the ladies took their seats, now took
up the palankeens: and the band of spearmen, arranging themselves
in front, were joined in the outer court by a strong body of the
Khan's horsemen, and the little procession quickly traversed the city,
and arrived at its destination. There the litters, being carried into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
the women's court of the Palace of the Seven Stories, were set down
at the foot of the stairs leading to the apartments in which the King
had held his night council.</p>

<p>Goolab, having shaken out her petticoat, and put into her ears and
about her neck, the gold ornaments she carried with her, appeared
once more in her proper character: and received the salutations of
the royal Mamas, who were to conduct the ladies to the chamber of
audience.</p>

<p>We have before described this apartment; and the broad daylight,
which poured through the now open casements, fully displayed its
richness and beauty. Soft quilted cloths had been laid over the floor,
and white muslin sheets tacked to them, covered the whole. Large
pillows had been placed round the walls; and in the deep bays and
oriel windows, numerous groups of ladies and their children were
sitting conversing together merrily, and spread, as it were, upon
every available space except the centre, which was kept clear.</p>

<p>Lurlee Khánum was not prepared for the display of rich dresses
which had to be encountered, but assured by the kind tones in which
she was welcomed by the Queen, sailed up to her with measured
steps, causing her ample satin garment to swing in heavy folds from
left to right, and back again, after the most impressive and courtly
fashion.</p>

<p>Fyz-ool-Nissa, the King's wife, was as yet a girl, not, indeed, much
older than Zyna herself. She could not be called beautiful, but there
was a frank pleasant expression in her fair countenance which was
irresistibly pleasing. The delicate hands and arms, sparkling with
jewels, were all that could be seen of her person, buried as it was
amidst the cloud of drapery which shrouded her as she sat on the
King's seat in the oriel, and seemed an earnest of its grace; as also,
indeed, her small graceful head and neck, which were loaded with
costly pearl ornaments.</p>

<p>"The wife and daughter of the noble Afzool Khan are always
welcome," said the Bégum, in her low sweet voice. "Come and sit
here by me; 'tis a fair sight to see all the gallant people assembling,
and they say it will be a great Durbar. And this is Zyna-bee? Ah,
girl, they have often told me thou wert fair, but&mdash;&mdash;Well, I had
better not say it. Come here, child, I am thy mother too; they tell
me I have many children," she said, laughing. "O, so many!"</p>

<p>"May God fill your lap with them, may they climb about you,
and may you live a hundred years to see them!" said Lurlee,
earnestly.</p>

<p>"And here is one already," said the Bégum, seating Zyna beside
her. "Ah, girl, we will have such a marriage for thee soon&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>As Zyna bowed down blushingly, Lurlee seized the opportunity of
pressing her suit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>"Lady," she said, putting up her hands in a respectful attitude,
"thine ear for a moment. I had a petition&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah, Khánum!" returned Fyz-ool-Nissa, with a look of disappointment;
"I had marked this day for rejoicing; for the heavy cloud
which has hung over my head so long is gone, and thou hast brought
me a petition, and I hate them. I never get matters arranged as I
like, and am vexed&mdash;&mdash;To-morrow, lady?"</p>

<p>"Only for my husband would I speak," replied Lurlee, firmly.
"He and his son were decoyed to the Kótwallee early to-day, and
they cannot get to the King. It must not be that Afzool Khan is
counted a laggard. O lady&mdash;&mdash;!" and here Lurlee, unable to contain
herself longer, burst into tears.</p>

<p>Fyz-ool-Nissa looked to Zyna, and saw a confirmation of Lurlee's
tale in the face&mdash;in those great eyes brimful of tears, and quivering lips.</p>

<p>"Hush!" said the Bégum, "this must not be known. O that
there were any one to write!"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I can write," said Zyna, timidly.</p>

<p>"Thou, girl? well done! Now," she continued, as an attendant
brought a writing-case, "write what thou wilt, but be quick."</p>

<p>It was soon done. A few words, but enough for the purpose.</p>

<p>"Canst thou sign it, lady?" asked Zyna.</p>

<p>"Yes, child, 'tis all they could ever teach me," replied the Bégum,
laughing; "and here is my seal, too. Ah! thou art a little clerk."</p>

<p>"Her father makes her write his letters," said Lurlee, apologetically,
as the Bégum clapped her hands, and an old eunuch, who had
been standing at the foot of the room, advanced.</p>

<p>"This must go to my lord instantly," said the Queen; "some one
thou canst count on must take it, Daood, for me."</p>

<p>"Myself," he replied; "no other can do this errand. Fear not,
lady," he continued earnestly to Lurlee, "thy noble lord hath friends
he knows not of, and it is needful he should be in the Durbar to-day.
Inshalla! thou wilt soon see him? Is any of the Paigah here to-day?"</p>

<p>"Yes," returned Lurlee, joyfully, "more than fifty men; they will
be with the troops without."</p>

<p>"I will return presently," said the man, bowing over his crossed
arms; "and if ye will watch your men ye will see whether the errand
be done or not."</p>

<p>So the ladies sat and looked out. Bright flashed the sun's rays
from spear and sword, morion and gauntlet, matchlock and shield,
of the troops gathering before the hall where the King sat: while
the gay turbans, vests of cloth-of-gold, satins and brocades, glowed
in the bright sunlight like a bed of gorgeous flowers.</p>

<p>"There are ten thousand brave hearts throbbing for my lord!"
cried the young Queen, clapping her hands. "Look, lady! O Alla,
such an array of armed men is fearful, yet beautiful!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ameen!" said Lurlee, earnestly. "A thousand times ten thousand
are at his call, if he will only lead them! Why shouldst thou
fear, lady? I have ridden with my lord in the battle and felt no
fear. But look! a thousand thanks and blessings be upon thee!
Yes, they go, Raheem Khan and all the spearmen. Dost thou not see
them, Zyna?"</p>

<p>"Yes, to bring my father and Fazil," cried Zyna, in her turn
clapping her hands exultingly. "Yes, they will repay thee, O my
queen&mdash;my mother; they will repay thee with their lives."</p>

<p>"Nay, no tears now, girl," said Fyz-ool-Nissa gaily. "Look out
over the cavaliers yonder, and wait patiently. Inshalla! your
people will return speedily."</p>

<p>So they sat, silently now, praying inwardly for their safety, though
the time seemed terribly long, as they looked over the gathering
masses of men: over the gardens, mosques, and palaces of the
nobility: and over the country beyond, where, in the quivering
noonday light, and now fervid heat, the blue distance seemed melting
into the sky.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XL" id="CHAPTER_XL">CHAPTER XL.</a></h2>


<p>Jehándar Beg felt that the communications he had heard might
have somewhat disarranged his appearance, and he would not for
the world be suspected by Afzool Khan of agitation of any kind; his
ample beard must not be disordered, nor a hair of his eyebrows
crooked. A glance in a small mirror, which hung in the anteroom,
proved that the barber's skill was necessary, and he sent for his own
servant. What other hand, indeed, could be allowed to meddle with
that glorious beard, or to regulate the orthodox breadth of the moustache
and eyebrows? Who understood the proper darkening of the
spot in the centre of the forehead, as if it were always being rubbed
against the ground in perpetual prayer, like Habeeb Méhtur, the
chief of his craft? and finally, who so admirable a chronicler of all
domestic scandal, in which Beejapoor was at least as prolific as other
cities of similar size and peculiarity of social morals?</p>

<p>So Habeeb, having been summoned, found his master sitting alone
where we last left him, reclining against his pillow in the small room
before described, and saw, at a glance, that his spirit was troubled.</p>

<p>Having made his obeisance, which was not acknowledged, or barely
so, the barber at once set to work, removing the conical lambskin
cap which Jehándar Beg always wore, and subjecting the whole
scalp to a series of manipulations which were inexpressibly soothing.
How lightly moved the practised fingers along lines of muscles and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
nerves! how carefully was every stray hair put back into its proper
place, or deftly eradicated with the sharp tweezers. Then, as the
momentous matters of eyebrows, moustache, and beard were severally
approached, and where the Kótwal's rough hand had rubbed his
chin, pushed up the moustache, or disturbed the eyebrows&mdash;till
every hair seemed battling with its neighbour or bristling in anger&mdash;all
was soon reduced to order, and the cap replaced. Jehándar
Beg felt a refreshing coolness pervade his head, the nervous excitement
was removed, and a calmness supervened which he required
for what he had to do.</p>

<p>Yes, a master in his art! Habeeb had made a masterly performance;
and yet so quickly!&mdash;long enough, however, for those much-coveted
papers to be taken far from his master's chance of possession
to a place of safety.</p>

<p>"Shookr, Shookr, Habeeb!" (Thanks, thanks!), said the Kótwal
at length. "Hast thou any news, friend?"</p>

<p>What was the barber to say? News? yes, plenty! There was
no lack of that, such as his master relished; but would it be welcome?</p>


<p>"There was a grand entertainment at the Nawab Alla-ool-Moolk's
last night, and some new singers from the Carnatic were there. My
lord should hear one of them. She is very lovely," he replied
cautiously.</p>

<p>"Except the blessed Mary, and Fáthma, and Ayésha&mdash;on whose
names be peace!&mdash;I wish all women were in the burning pit," said
Jehándar Beg savagely, and his hand approached his beard.</p>

<p>"Khóda na khasta bashud!" (God forbid!), exclaimed Habeeb,
staying it. "God forbid my lord should touch what has been done!
Even in that exclamation a hundred hairs have started up. May
his slave ask what has discomposed the fountain of justice this
morning?"</p>

<p>"There was some one ill in the palace last night, and a Fakeer was
sent for, who shouted 'Ulla dilâyâ to léonga,' Who was that man?
and who was ill?" asked Jehándar Beg, not heeding the question.</p>

<p>"My lord, no one was ill that I know of. About the Fakeer I
will ascertain, if possible," replied the barber. "I can tell my lord one
thing, however: the Shah&mdash;may his splendour increase&mdash;went out,
even as the Khaleefa, of honoured memory, of whom we read&mdash;Haroun
bin-al Rasheed&mdash;was in the habit of doing, to see after his
subjects for himself, to hear with his own ears; and, if people say
the truth, there is enough for him to hear, if he chose to inquire."</p>

<p>The men understood each other perfectly, and exchanged glances.</p>

<p>"People will talk, friend," said the Kótwal; "but where did he
go? if thou'rt sure he went."</p>

<p>"Nay, that is more than your poor slave knows. They say he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
took the young Fazil Khan with him, or else the Wuzeer's son.
Sure he went? yes, my lord, quite sure," said the man, emphatically.
"I was in the citadel, and saw him go out."</p>

<p>"Ay, indeed! Boy's tricks, boy's tricks, Habeeb; yet that Fazil
Khan was accounted a steady youth: but he is in trouble about
last night."</p>

<p>"Ah, master! we have all been like him once," said the barber,
chuckling. "I suppose it was one of the new dancers&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Except that we did no murder, friend," returned the Kótwal,
interrupting him.</p>

<p>"Is my lord <i>very</i> particular about a noble slaying a thief, or a
night brawler?" asked the barber.</p>

<p>"O no! and it will be settled. And now you may go, Habeeb&mdash;find
out who was visited last night; perhaps ... no matter ...
and thou shalt have thy mouth filled, after our Persian fashion,
with gold zecchins and sugar-candy. There are a couple in earnest
of more."</p>

<p>"May the sun of your splendour increase in brightness, master!"
returned the man, taking the money, and retreating backwards till
he gained the door. "I will inquire&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And now for this boy and his rough father," said Jehándar Beg,
speaking to himself, as the door closed on the barber; "if they
could be gained? Well, I must see. If not&mdash;we cannot allow
them to live; they are too powerful," and he rose and went into the
outer hall.</p>

<p>"And no one has passed here, Jaffur?" said Jehándar Beg to
the Nubian slave, who, with some others, watched the door of the
court where Afzool Khan was confined.</p>

<p>"No one, my lord, except the servants with their meal."</p>

<p>"Did they speak to him?"</p>

<p>"Not a word, my lord; I listened carefully."</p>

<p>"Have the Khan and his son been speaking to each other?"</p>

<p>"Yes, frequently; but as they have moved to the other side of
the court, which is now in shadow, I cannot hear them. My lord
is going in? Should we not attend? They are armed."</p>

<p>"I am not afraid, Jaffur; put up thy weapon. Keep the door
ajar, but do not enter, and, on your life, let no one listen. Do ye
hear, all of ye?"</p>

<p>"Jo hookum!" (as you order), cried all together, dispersing as
the Kótwal entered.</p>

<p>Afzool Khan and his son were sitting, as Jaffur had described, in
the opposite corner of the court from the door; for the sun was
now shining with a painful glare of heat into that side by which
the Kótwal entered, while, opposite, the cool verandah was rendered
more refreshing from the shadow of a large champa tree, which fell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
over the building and enclosure where they were. They rose
courteously as the Kótwal advanced, and, saluting him gravely, yet
without any expression of impatience at detention, requested him to
be seated.</p>

<p>It was no part of Jehándar Beg's policy to attempt to bully. If
he could find out what the affair of the night had really been, or
obtain a clue to the truth of that which had been alleged of the
King; in short, anything which might serve as a guide to action, or
as means of warning to the Wuzeer, it would be enough.</p>

<p>"I trust my honoured guests have been fittingly attended to?"
he asked, as he subsided on his heels at a respectful distance from
the old Khan, joining his hands after the most deferential and
most elegant of Persian customs. "I trust the repast was served
hot. My lords must excuse my absence, and my being taken
unawares. Had I expected the honour of their company, then,
indeed, Zoolficar's skill should have been put forth."</p>

<p>"The kabobs and kichéri were excellent, Meerza Sahib," replied
Afzool Khan, politely. "I was to have had the same at my own
house; and there were other dishes, too. Verily, your cook must
be a treasure; there is not such another in the city."</p>

<p>"My lord, a poor slave, who followed me from my own dear
country, and has remained here with me. Yes, he has a pretty skill
in the art, and ... but you have yet to know what he can do....
If I might send him one day&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Shookr, shookr! (thanks), Meerza Sahib. Yes, we will see
about it. Inshalla! inshalla!" replied the Khan, cheerily, "an
excellent idea&mdash;and come yourself."</p>

<p>The Kótwal thought he had made a favourable impression.
"After all, there was nothing in the murder matter that you need
care about, Meah Sahib," he continued blandly, to Fazil Khan.
"Pardon me if I was rude this morning, but when we are at
business, you know, there can be no distinction of persons."</p>

<p>"None," said Fazil, gravely; "but who was the man found dead?
You said one had been killed."</p>

<p>"O, only a Kafir Hindu; some son of a burnt father, who is
gone to burn with him," laughed the Kótwal. "I don't know; the
body is not yet claimed. By the way, Meah, it was strange enough
that you should have been just in time to save that Lalla."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes; what has become of him?" asked Fazil innocently.
"You promised he should be seen to."</p>

<p>"And I have done as I promised, Meah. Habeeb has dressed the
wound, which is but a scratch, and the man has eaten heartily;
perhaps he was not much hurt, after all."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not," said Fazil, significantly, "but it was well he fell
into good hands."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," returned the Kótwal, musingly, "was it not strange what
he told the Duffadar about Pahar Singh and the Shah's secretary?
I have heard that my lord, the Meerza, was out last night late, and
at a temple. Could it have been there?"</p>

<p>"To meet Pahar Singh? I should hardly say it was likely,"
returned Fazil.</p>

<p>"Nay, more, that the Asylum of the Faith&mdash;the King himself&mdash;was
there also. At least&mdash;at least&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Fazil saw Jehándar Beg was not sure. It was a mere guess, for
which there was perhaps suspicion, but he laughed aloud and replied,
"A good joke, Meerza Sahib; perhaps they say I was with him!"</p>

<p>"Well," returned the Kótwal, wagging his head, "the fact is,
they do; and perhaps you were, my young friend. Let me see; his
highness is about your own age. When I was as old I remember
the Shah, with some others of us, used to have frolics now and then
in the bazars of Isfahan. Ah, Meah, there were&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Fazil made a gesture, as if his father, who was sitting bolt
upright, with his eyes shut, might not like to hear the remainder.</p>

<p>"Yes," continued the Kótwal, "if ye did go, what matter?"</p>

<p>"I have before said that Bulwunt Rao was my companion, not
the King; and the rest you know of," interrupted the young Khan.</p>

<p>"Not all, Meah; but we are out of court now, and I am quite sure
of my young friend's good faith to let me know anything that concerns
the state interests, the King, or the Wuzeer; and so, Meah
Sahib, if we could examine those papers together&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah, yes! the papers, Meerza, you would not understand them&mdash;they
were Mahratta."</p>

<p>"But we could find a Karkoon to read them, and you are known
to speak that language, Meah?"</p>

<p>"True, Meerza Sahib, I do; but the papers are not here&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not here, sir!" cried Jehándar Beg, with an ominous scowl
passing over his face, at which Afzool Khan involuntarily allowed
his hand to steal to his sword hilt, as it lay on the ground. "Not
here?"</p>

<p>"Not here," echoed Fazil demurely, dropping his eyes.</p>

<p>"But they were here when you came this morning?"</p>

<p>"Certainly they were; and one of our people took them home
for me."</p>

<p>"Yet you promised they should be forthcoming whenever I required
them? Beware, Fazil Khan, how you entangle yourself in
this matter," returned the Kótwal, sternly.</p>

<p>"I do not think I made any promise, Meerza Sahib," replied
Fazil; "'tis you who must be mistaken, pardon me for saying so.
I said they concerned the King, our lord and master, and would be
shown to him only: and in Durbar to-day they will be presented to
him. You will be there, of course?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>"By Alla!" exclaimed the Kótwal; "but if&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>At the oath the old Khan fairly took his sword in his left hand,
and placed it across his knees, while he looked grimly at his host;
and Fazil saw the upper portion of his father's moustache, where it
touched his cheek, quivering with suppressed rage.</p>

<p>Jehándar Beg checked himself, and said, deferentially, "Forgive
the oath, Khan Sahib, and you know enough of Persians to excuse
it. It would have been pleasant, as fellow-servants of the King, to
have shared your confidence. As it is denied, I yield the point;
and you are welcome to all the credit of the service you will do my
lord. But what say you, gentlemen, to assisting me to re-examine
that Khayet who is detained without; you acknowledge, Meah
Sahib, at least, that he was rescued by you&mdash;perhaps from death?"</p>

<p>"You have a strange memory, Kótwal Sahib, to-day," said Fazil,
smiling. "I never said I rescued him, I think. Send for the man;
no doubt you will hear all you wish from him, and will believe
him. I do not appear to be very credible to you to-day."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XLI" id="CHAPTER_XLI">CHAPTER XLI.</a></h2>


<p>As the Kótwal rose to go to the door, the old Khan whispered to his
son, "We can seize him, Fazil, if needs be, and put a dagger into
him. The man is not fit to live. He is even now plotting something;
I know it, trust him not, my son."</p>

<p>"If needs be, father, I am ready; but no violence yet," replied
Fazil; "wait till the Wuzeer's son is announced."</p>

<p>"The man has been sent for," said Jehándar Beg, returning to his
seat, "and will be here presently." He had given his own directions
to the guard outside to stand by the door, yet no nearer than was
needful for precaution.</p>

<p>The Lalla was not long detained. Almost as Jehándar Beg had
seated himself&mdash;this time a little nearer to Fazil&mdash;he opened the
door, which was closed after him, and advanced towards the party
in a courtly but respectful manner. Fazil hardly recognized the man,
so completely had rest and good clothes improved him. His face was
clean shaved, his moustache and hair were trimmed and oiled. His
small turban tied neatly in the Nustalik fashion of the imperial
court, which was strange at Beejapoor. The clothes he wore, though
somewhat too large, were yet clean white muslin; and a handsome
Persian shawl over his shoulders, proved that his personal comfort
had been well attended to under Jehándar Beg's orders.</p>

<p>"I trust you are better now," said Fazil to the Lalla, kindly, as,
after his very courtly advance, in which he bowed his head very low,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
turned out his toes very wide, and put his elbows as far behind him
as possible, he sat down much after the manner of Jehándar Beg, on
the left hand of the Kótwal.</p>

<p>"My lord's house will prosper for his kindness to a poor stranger,"
said the Lalla. "What more delightful to exercise, what more
grateful to God, than hospitality?" and he quoted a verse from the
poet Saadi on the subject, which he followed by another and another.</p>

<p>"Enough, friend," said Jehándar Beg, laughing. "No need to
prove your scholarly attainments; they are not needed at present.
Now, we all bid you not to fear; but tell us, in plain terms, what
happened before this brave young gentleman rescued you last night."</p>

<p>The Lalla was not very clear as to what course he was to take; he,
too, was watching his game.</p>

<p>"My lord, noble sirs, they were Gosais who found me in the temple,
and ye are Moslem gentlemen, or nobles."</p>

<p>"Very true," said Fazil. "Now, look at me carefully, and try if
you cannot remember me as one who lifted you up after you had
been robbed."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes, noble sir, now I do remember," cried the Lalla; "I owe
my life to you, sir, my life. When I screamed, you must have heard
me. I pray you, let me kiss your feet."</p>

<p>The action was an ordinary one of gratitude, yet enough to admit
of Fazil's passing a well-known signal of silence to the man as he
removed his hands, while the old Khan cried grimly&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Make your reverence to your God, if you have one, not to my
son. Is he an idol, that you bow down to him?"</p>

<p>"I mean no offence; pardon me, my lord," said the Lalla, humbly.
"I was only&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The opening of the door interrupted the Lalla's speech, which
would have been very flowery and hyperbolic.</p>

<p>An attendant entered and spoke to the Kótwal. "My lord,
Kowas Khan has arrived; is he to be admitted?"</p>

<p>"Tell him I kiss his hands; I am engaged with these worthy
gentlemen," returned Jehándar Beg, looking round; "and pray ask
him to excuse me for a short time. If he would like a hooka, or
coffee, or sherbet, let him have all he desires."</p>

<p>"And his attendants?"</p>

<p>"Let any of proper rank sit with him, the rest can remain in the
outer court."</p>

<p>"Very good, my lord," said the servant, and he shut the door.</p>

<p>During this interruption, a very pretty piece of pantomime had
been executed between the eyes of Fazil and the Lalla. It would
have been more complete, perhaps, could Fazil have used his hands
also, but he dare not. As it was, however, the Lalla seemed to
understand all that was required; and the delightfully comprehensive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
manner in which he half shut his eyes, bowed his head, and smiled
blandly though almost imperceptibly, would have been fit example
for any diplomatist. Nothing could be seen by the Kótwal, for, in
order to speak to the servant, it had been requisite for him to lean
behind the Lalla's back.</p>

<p>Jehándar Beg lost two points by his movement; one we have seen,
the other was a more serious one. For as he moved, the letters which
had been given to him by Moro Trimmul's agent, and which he had
put into a side-pocket of his dress, protruded a little as he reached
over, and, when he settled himself again, remained projecting half
out of that receptacle. He was not aware of it, but they attracted
Fazil's immediate attention. These he must have at any risk&mdash;for
he had seen the seal of the rebel Rajah on them&mdash;and he again
roused his father by the short cough they had agreed upon.</p>

<p>"Now, Lallajee, tell us all. You see you are among friends; but
we are hungry for fruit&mdash;flowers do not satisfy us," said Jehándar
Beg, jocosely rubbing his hands, and speaking in Persian, his own
language.</p>

<p>"My lords, what can I say?" returned the Lalla, simply. "I am
what you see, a poor scholar. Delhi is full of such, and we are
starving. Every one said, 'Go to the King of the Dekhan; he is
wise, he is generous, he is accomplished; he is a patron of literature.'
So your poor servant prepared two copies of verses; one in Sanscrit,
in which the third letter of every line is the same, T&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mashalla!" said Jehándar Beg, laughing, "Te-tum&mdash;te te, te-ta-te
to, Te ta-hah! Like that, Lallajee? O yes; our Brahmuns
here make odes, in which all the words end in skri, pri, dri; or else
msh, kshsh, rshsh-dshush. One would think all the mud in the Dekhan
was squelching under their feet; but go on."</p>

<p>"My lord is pleased to be witty," returned the Lalla, with a bland
smile, turning towards his host and joining hands. "Then I had a
Persian ode. It was nothing&mdash;nothing&mdash;a poor thing altogether;
only, if my lords wish, I could repeat it. Methinks there was some
elegance about it, if nothing else."</p>

<p>"God forbid!" returned the Kótwal, echoed by Fazil and the
Khan. "Go on."</p>

<p>"Well, my lords, as you wish," continued the Lalla. "Some other
day I may be more fortunate; and, with your permission, I will
resume my history. I had saved a few gold pieces, and I had
enough to keep my family for a year. I left them in my house,
and I have gradually made my way hither by Ahmednugger and
Sholapoor. That is all."</p>

<p>"Go on," said Fazil. "How didst thou get here from Sholapoor?"</p>

<p>"I came with some Gosais, as they appeared to be, who met me at
a village, Al&mdash;, Al&mdash;. I forget&mdash;just after you cross the river
Bheema."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>"Almella," suggested the Khan, interrupting him.</p>

<p>"Yes, that was it. They said they knew of a comfortable lodging
in a temple or a mutt; but if we arrived late we must be content
with whatever shelter we could get. I do not know, sirs, whether
they purposely delayed me by the way&mdash;for, indeed, the roads were
very muddy; but we arrived after sunset, and they took me to a
temple of Bhowani, in a grove. So long as it was light the place
did not look amiss for temporary shelter; but when it grew dark,
and the wind began to moan in the trees, I thought, sirs, that the
men's looks changed, and&mdash;and I began to tremble, yet unable to
help myself&mdash;as one lies bound sometimes in a dream.</p>

<p>"What could your slave do, sirs? At length they talked
together in an unknown tongue, and all fell upon me, strangled me,
and took what money I had, and my clothes, and I knew no more
till this valiant gentleman and some one else roused me and took me
to a guard-house, where I was well cared for."</p>

<p>"Why do you tell lies?" said the Kótwal, who, though unable to
make objection to the very probable story which the Lalla had
invented, felt conscious there was no truth in it. "Ah, man with a
burnt father, tell the truth; we are no enemies of thine! Do not eat
dirt at our hands! Why did the Shah's secretary visit thee at the
temple? Speak; it shall be well for thee. We are all friends of his
Majesty's here."</p>

<p>A very slight compression of Fazil's under lip was sufficient guide
for the Lalla. "The King's secretary? God defend us!" cried the
Lalla, innocently; "what should I have to do with the secretary?
Ah, sirs, why this oppression of a poor slave like me&mdash;a stranger
without friends? Did you see the secretary when you came to rescue
me, noble sir?"</p>

<p>"Not I, indeed; thou wast lying among the ashes, senseless
enough. All we heard was a scream, which sounded like one in
distress, and we entered the court," said Fazil, simply.</p>

<p>The Kótwal looked from one to the other, but he could find out
no sign of intelligence. He was fairly puzzled.</p>

<p>"Then why that respectable Duffadar's account of what you said to
him in the guard-house?" cried Jehándar Beg, jerking himself suddenly
round so as to confront the Lalla, while he seconded the movement
by an emphatic blow on the floor. "What about Pahar Singh?"</p>

<p>As he did so, his sleeve caught one of the letters projecting from
his pocket, which flew into the centre of the group. Fazil picked
it up, and returned it with a polite bow, but not before he had
distinctly seen the seal of the Rajah Sivaji Bhóslay upon it, and the
memorandum in the corner, which Jehándar Beg had written
for the Wuzeer, and marked private. Jehándar Beg's confusion on
receiving the letter could not be concealed, and Fazil felt that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
having seen what was not intended for him, he was in greater
danger than before.</p>

<p>"What about Pahar Singh?" echoed the Lalla, who had observed
the confused expression of Jehándar Beg's countenance, and seen
also what he was quite familiar with, the rebel Rajah's seal. "My
lord, your servant heard a great deal of him, as he came here through
the country. Everybody, from Ahmednugger to Sholapoor, spoke
of Pahar Singh, and warned me of Pahar Singh, but the Gosais
did not appear to fear him, and said he never touched companies of
travelling beggars. I remember now," continued the Lalla, dreamily,
"I think some one asked me whether Pahar Singh had robbed me.
Perhaps I said yes, I don't know; I might have said anything, good
sirs, for I was like one in a hideous dream; and this robber everybody
appeared to know:&mdash;in the bazars, in temples, mutts, serais&mdash;Pahar
Singh, Pahar Singh&mdash;nothing but Pahar Singh all the way.
I heard enough of him."</p>

<p>"Thou liest, Lalla. I have warned thee once, and again warn
thee&mdash;beware of the torture!" cried Jehándar Beg savagely, and
from between his closed teeth; "a word and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Jehándar Beg," said Afzool Khan, interrupting, "you and I are
old friends, and I am your guest, so also is this man. Good or evil
of him I know not, neither do I care: but torture shall not be used;
and so far as I know or have seen, he says nothing but the truth.
We are helpless enough here, my son and I, but we will not allow
him to be touched with any of your vile instruments. Question
him otherwise as you please, it is your duty."</p>

<p>The tone of the old Khan's voice, habitually stern, seemed more
so than usual to Jehándar Beg. Should he resent it and call in his
men? It was the thought of a moment. He would have done
this, but that he knew the Wuzeer's son sat without; he, at least,
was faithful to Fazil, and might not object to prove his devotion to
the old Khan, in the hope of its doing service in his suit for Zyna.</p>

<p>"Khan Sahib&mdash;&mdash;" returned Jehándar Beg, putting up his joined
hands.</p>

<p>He could not finish the sentence. Fazil, on pretence of arranging
his shawl about his shoulders, threw it with a sudden gesture over
the Kótwal's head, and closed it behind, throwing Jehándar Beg on
his face, while, at the same instant, a dagger flashed from the old
Khan's waist-band, and was held by him close to the Kótwal's heart,
and so that the point actually pricked the skin.</p>

<p>"Take out those letters, Lalla, from his pocket. In the name of
the Prophet&mdash;if one sound escape him, father&mdash;strike deep and hard.
Here is another traitor as bad as him we know of. There, hold his
legs, Lalla. Wah, wah! thou art a noble fellow; fear not, friend&mdash;we
are not like the Jogi. There, that will do; and well was it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
done," continued Fazil, as the Lalla rapidly passed an end of his
own scarf round the Kótwal's arms, and tied it in a knot behind his
back; "he is safe now. Where is his ring? give it to me, quick."</p>

<p>"Beware, Jehándar Beg," growled Afzool Khan, who leant over
the prostrate man without altering his position, as the Lalla loosed
the ring, "I do not want to kill thee, good fellow; but, by Alla, if
thou strivest ever so little, this knife will go through thee. I am
no friend to traitors, as thou well knowest; so keep quiet."</p>

<p>It was a bold stroke; but in such emergencies desperate efforts
are generally the most successful. Fazil took the Kótwal's signet-ring,
and went to the door. The slave Jaffur looked at it for an
instant, bowed his head, and crossed his arms; while Fazil, looking
round the hall, beckoned to his friend, who, attended by some
twenty of his followers, sat upon the dais.</p>

<p>Kowas Khan arose instantly, and with him the men, who made
their salutations, and advanced towards the door. The slaves believed
that the Wuzeer's son had been sent for, and stood aside to
let him pass: and as the young men embraced in the doorway,
Fazil whispered to his friend to disarm them, and hold the door. A
pressure of the hand was the sure reply.</p>

<p>"I will return with my shawl," said Kowas Khan aloud, going
back towards his seat, "and I will follow you directly."</p>

<p>A moment afterwards Fazil and the Khan heard a few low cries,
a struggle, and a slight clash of arms. The surprise had been complete.
The slaves were disarmed, thrust into the Wuzeer's private
room, and the doors closed.</p>

<p>"Fear not, noble friends," cried the cheery voice of the Wuzeer's
son, as he stood in the doorway, "ye are safe, and no one is hurt.
I have five hundred men of my own body-guard in the courts, on
foot and horseback; and, Inshalla! we can hold the Kótwallee
against an army. May I come?"</p>

<p>"Ul-humd-ul-illa!" cried the Khan and his son together, "hazar
shookr, hazar shookr!&mdash;(A thousand thanks!) O holy 'Geesoo
Duraz!' I vow to thee a thousand lights, and a chain of gold for
the canopy of thy blessed sepulchre," continued the Khan, devoutly.</p>

<p>"Come, friend and brother," said Fazil; "come here and see
what treachery doth in the most trusted places&mdash;nay, fear us not,
Jehándar Beg," he continued; "we are not arbiters in your destiny&mdash;it
rests in higher hands than ours. Father, take away the knife
from his heart."</p>

<p>"I don't know that I ought," said the old Khan, grimly. "I
shall keep it ready, and near thee, Jehándar Beg. I trust thee not,
my friend."</p>

<p>"You are more lucky than I am," returned the Kótwal, sadly.
"When a man's fate deserts him, he need not struggle&mdash;he is helpless,"
and he quoted a verse from the Gulistan to that effect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>"Shabash! a scholarly quotation," said the Lalla, gravely. "And
now, gentlemen, if ye will trust a poor Mutsuddee, who has some
experience, we will examine this worthy gentleman's pockets; and
if he has any private writing-cases, something might be found in
them also."</p>

<p>"Peace, Lalla!" cried Fazil, sternly; "what we do concerns thee
not. But thou hast been faithful and intelligent, and we will see
thee rewarded."</p>

<p>What was found in the search will presently appear; meanwhile,
we need to see how those assembled with the King, in his royal
court, were employed.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XLII" id="CHAPTER_XLII">CHAPTER XLII.</a></h2>


<p>The great Hall of Audience in the Citadel was only used on state
occasions of ceremony. It formed part of the oldest division of the
royal residence, and was built, as report had it, after a model in
Turkey or Persia, in both of which countries the founder of the
dynasty, Ibrahim Adil Shah, had resided. But as no such model is
known to exist, it is more probable that one of the Turkish architects
whom he had invited to his camp, and to whose Europeanized
skill and taste most of the noble Saracenic Gothic buildings of the
city owed their origin, had designed and executed the whole under
the direction of his munificent patron.</p>

<p>The "Ark," or Citadel of Beejapoor, is a fortress in itself, and
the area is surrounded by a beautiful stone wall, having heavy
bastions at intervals, and a fausse braye, also with bastions; both
being protected by a broad wet ditch. The main entrance is by
a causeway, defended by a gateway, flanked by bastions of great
strength. The whole of the interior was laid out in palaces, under
various denominations, and public buildings, such as the courts of
civil and criminal justice, the treasury, the military and revenue
record offices, and the like, and the great Hall of Audience, which
now concerns us.</p>

<p>A broad road from the second gateway led nearly through the
centre of the Citadel, as you entered, to the Màidân, or plain of
exercise. The Palace of the Seven Stories, and the buildings connected
with it, lay on the left hand, and the "Sunget Mahal," or
Palace of Assembly, with other heavy blocks of building, public
and private, to the right. All these palaces, at the time of which
we write, were interspersed with courts and gardens; but the space
before the great Hall, called the Màidân or Plain, was kept exclusively
for the assembly, inspection, or exercise of royal troops on
particular occasions, and also as the waiting-place of the "sowarees,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
or retinues, which attended those who visited the palace on ordinary
business.</p>

<p>The hall itself was a very noble building. It stood upon a low
basement, beneath which were crypts, probably used for archives, or
as magazines; and was entered by flights of steps, which led into
corridors at each side. The front was entirely open, consisting of
one immense Gothic arch, ninety-two feet in span, and of proportionate
height, and of two narrow lancet-shaped arches of corresponding
height, one on each side, which opened on the side corridors.</p>

<p>The interior consisted of one immense room, unbroken to the
roof; but upon its south side, and partially also east and west, there
were projections built upon cloisters, which contained rooms and
galleries; especially to the south, where there was a closed latticed
balcony, where the ladies of the court might sit and look on at
ceremonies of reception or rejoicing, and where the King might
receive the petitions or salutations of the people without inconvenience.
Above these galleries and balconies was another story,
with open turrets at the corners, and suites of apartments above.
As the building stands now, a mere shell, bereft of roof and floors,
and with all, except its noble arches and cloisters, crumbling
gradually to decay, it is a noble and impressive structure, and
enough remains to estimate what it must have been when perfect.</p>

<p>A busy and interesting scene it was, even to those concerned. As
each "sowaree" arrived at the entrance steps, it was met by a number
of "chobdars," and mirdhas, or attendants, bearing massive gold
and silver sticks, or clubs covered with chased silver or gold; dressed
exclusively in white muslin, wearing small circular turbans, flattened
out at the sides, muslin tunics, tight to the waist, and descending
thence in thickly-gathered robes to the feet, which gave them the
appearance of petticoats. These men attended officers of higher
rank, who were, in fact, chamberlains, and whose duty it was to
conduct the various visitors to the presence of the King, to proclaim
aloud their titles, and to marshal them to their seats. Without, the
royal Abyssinian and Dekhani guards prevented violence among
their retainers.</p>

<p>Once the broad corridor at either side was reached by the visitors
there was no further interruption; and though the war of struggle,
gibe, and quarrel, peculiar to such an assembly, came hoarsely and
with a stifled sound through the arches into the hall:&mdash;within,
there was a decorous, if not, indeed, a solemn and impressive silence.
Men spoke to each other hardly above their breath; and the soft
murmur arising from thousands of such half whispers ascended and
seemed to float tremblingly among the balconies, and up to the lofty
roof of the building.</p>

<p>The King had early taken his seat. The musnud, or royal throne,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
was under the centre of the balcony before mentioned, upon a dais,
raised a step above the general floor of the hall. There was no
decoration visible upon it; and it consisted of a wide cushion and
pillows, covered with white muslin, supported at the back and
sides by a railing of wood, covered with plates of gold which, indeed,
appeared as if of solid gold. On the right hand of the King, who
was dressed in simple white muslin, with a single gold ornament in
his turban, sat the Peer Bundagee Sahib, the religious instructor
we have before mentioned; and at the back of the rail the Secretary,
with two young nobles, whose hereditary office it was to wave over
the King the jewelled Mórchas, or fans of peacock feathers.</p>

<p>Farther again behind, among the arches, closing up the entrance
to the cloisters, and leaning against the pillars, were servants bearing
the King's weapons, the Aftábgeeree, or sun-shades, the royal
umbrellas, and the private guard of slaves, mostly Nubian eunuchs.</p>

<p>Like the monarch's seat, the whole of the floor was covered by
quilted cotton carpets, over which white muslin was spread; so that,
with the exception of here and there a coloured scarf or waist-belt,
and an occasional turban ornament, the whole of the persons seated
wore the same character of dress as the King, with little variation.
In some respects the assembly had a monotonous appearance; but,
on the other hand, the effect was chaste and solemn, and agreed
with the plain undecorated character of the building.</p>

<p>The privileged attendants, however, who were allowed entrance
with their masters, and who stood in files behind them against the
wall, were dressed in the brightest and gayest colours which could
be devised. Here were tunics of satin and cloth-of-gold, brocaded
turbans and scarfs of the richest materials, mingled together in
the greatest profusion; and this brilliant array, in which all hues
seemed to blend with a strangely gorgeous harmony, formed a
powerful background in relief of the white dresses, and white
coverings of the floor.</p>

<p>Then beyond, the eye followed the graceful outline of the vast
arch against a deep blue sky, flecked with light clouds. Below, it
rested upon the plain, where, in the quivering heat, which gave a
tremulous movement to the atmosphere, stood the serried masses of
royal troops and sowarees, comparisoned elephants and led horses,
litters and their bearers&mdash;all in the glowing colours which we have
already seen from the Queen's balcony; and with bright arms and
armour, which flashed and glinted in a thousand sparkles as the
wearers moved.</p>

<p>The Secretary and the Peer had noted, carefully and jealously, the
names of the several nobles and sirdars as they were announced by the
mirdhas in attendance&mdash;presented their customary nuzzurs or offerings,
according to their rank, and were conducted to their places;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
and every now and then one or other whispered to the King, as
neutral or suspected persons passed, or when the appearance of a
well-known loyal friend gave assurance of support. Still Afzool
Khan's place was vacant, and that of the Wuzeer. It was true the
latter could not yet be expected, but his son might at least be
present; and the double absence cast a gloom over the King's face,
which he could barely conceal.</p>

<p>"I had counted upon Afzool Khan and his son Fazil," said the
King, mournfully, to the Peer, "but you see they have not come.
We might not expect Kowas Khan without his father; but I had
thought Afzool Khan among the truest of my people&mdash;what think
ye?"</p>

<p>The Peer could give but little consolation. He, too, had expected
the Khan, and had had no doubts of his fidelity; so also the Secretary;
but his unaccountable absence disturbed them both.</p>

<p>Just then the lady Lurlee's escort, entering the open space,
wheeled up among other troops, and the leader, Raheem Khan,
dashed at speed to the foot of the basement, made his reverence to
the King, and followed his men to the position they had taken up.</p>

<p>"Ah," cried the Peer, joyfully, to the King, "those are Afzool
Khan's 'sowaree'; the old Khan and his son are not far off now,
Shookr-Oolla;" and he looked anxiously to the side entrance, in the
hope of seeing him advance with his son from the archway in the
corridor. Others came on, but neither appeared.</p>

<p>"What hinders Afzool Khan?" said the Secretary to the Peer,
after a while; "who is detaining him?"</p>

<p>"Send and inquire," said the King.</p>

<p>"Go," said the Peer to a mirdha in attendance, "and see if Afzool
Khan be in the corridor; if not, go to his officer and inquire where
he is,&mdash;not as if our Prince had asked, but from me." The King,
to whom the man looked for orders, nodded assent, and he departed
and returned speedily.</p>

<p>"I examined both corridors, and he was not in either, Huzrut,"
he said to the holy man, "so I went to Raheem Khan, who tells me
he has come with the Khánum;" and here his voice dropped
almost to a whisper, "that Afzool Khan hath been at the Kótwal's,
at Jehándar Beg's, since morning, and it is particular business, as
both he and his son have been in private consultation with him
since sunrise."</p>

<p>The King had leaned over the rail to hear the detail, but he had
not noticed the first part of the message; and as the man receded
among the attendants behind, looked from one to the other of his
friends, but could gather no consolation from their faces.</p>

<p>"It is but too true, my lord," said the Secretary sadly; "we need
not expect them; for the Wuzeer's son, with a heavy body of horse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
and foot, has just gone to the Kótwallee&mdash;he was seen with them
not long ago passing the fort gate. Jehándar Beg is not come, and
it is clear to me that they have garrisoned the Kótwallee, and will
defend it till the Wuzeer arrives, when they will declare revolt.
Sending a party here is but a blind."</p>

<p>"And who are here to check it?" asked the King apprehensively.</p>

<p>"Many, my lord," replied the Peer earnestly; "all the Dekhanies
are my disciples, and I will answer for them to a man. All the
artillery are with them. Fear not."</p>

<p>The King looked inquiringly to his Secretary.</p>

<p>"Yes, my Prince," he said, "fear not: we cannot wait for them;
nothing good ever came of vacillation or expediency. Bismilla!
shall I order silence?"</p>

<p>"Bismilla-ir-rahman-ir-raheem!" exclaimed the King devoutly,
looking up. "I am ready. Order silence," he said to one of the
mirdhas.</p>

<p>"Khámôsh! silence!" cried the man in a loud, deep voice,
which rang through the hall, and sounded strangely, interrupting
the loose murmuring chat which had prevailed before&mdash;"Khámôsh!"</p>

<p>"Khámôsh!" was reiterated by all the mirdhas and chobdars
stationed about the hall, and by the attendants behind, and was
taken up by those in the corridors, spreading to the crowd without,
and to the troops&mdash;"Khámôsh!"</p>

<p>The silence that ensued was almost oppressive. In the hall itself,
after the men had once more settled themselves in their seats, there
was not a sound or murmur. The struggles and gibes without
ceased, and even the troops were still, save where a neigh, or the
rattle of caparisons, as horses tossed their heads or champed their
bits, broke the stillness; or an elephant, clashing his bells, and being
admonished by his driver, lifted his trunk, and gave a short scream.</p>

<p>It was the Secretary's office to open the business of the day, and
just as he was about to speak, the chief of the eunuchs entered,
bearing the Queen's billet, and kneeling down behind the rail, while
he spoke aside, covering his mouth, said to the King hastily&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is a matter of life or death. If Afzool Khan hath any favour
in your eyes, O King, save him! there may be time."</p>

<p>"This is some trick on thee, Daood," said the King sneeringly;
"we know where he is, and how employed. He is ours no longer,
and hath left us of his own free will."</p>

<p>"His wife and daughter are with the Bégum Sahiba. Read that,
and you will know why," answered the man firmly.</p>

<p>"Can it be true?" asked the King of the Peer, opening the note.
"Ya Khubeer, O!" he continued, after a pause: "this is wonderful!
wonderful! O friends! and yet we had suspected our noble
friend. But he is true; see, here is our royal signet to this; no
doubt, no doubt."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>"What is it?" cried both the Peer and the Secretary in a breath,
seeing the King much excited.</p>

<p>"Afzool Khan and his son are imprisoned at the Kótwallee, and
prevented from attending. They must be brought instantly."</p>

<p>"Imprisoned?" cried both together.</p>

<p>"Yes, friends," continued the King, "there is treachery in this,
for Jehándar Beg and the Wuzeer are one, it is clear now, and we
must act at once. Ismail Khan," continued he firmly, to an officer
who stood behind him clothed in a shirt of mail, "go thou with two
hundred of the royal guard, and some of the mirdhas, bring
Jehándar Beg to the presence, and with him Afzool Khan and his
son."</p>

<p>"I beg to petition," said the eunuch, "that some of Afzool Khan's
Paigah are here, who came with their mistress; they might as well
go, if I might send them."</p>

<p>"Of course," replied the King, "why not send the whole Paigah?"</p>

<p>"Excellent," said the Peer; "take what are here with thee,
Ismail Khan, at once, and send for the rest. Raheem Khan will
not fail thee."</p>

<p>"I am gone, my lord, and will take him with me; he is my son-in-law."</p>

<p>"Ah, I had forgotten. Go; fear not; bring them safely and
quickly, friend, for we have much need of their presence."</p>

<p>"Ya Ulla Kureem!" said the Peer devoutly, looking up, "this is
thy doing. O, dear old friend! thou art not gone from among us
as we had feared. Bismilla, let us proceed! first with these letters
of Sivaji's, then with the rest. Afzool Khan will be here by that
time, and the people will rise to his call as a man. Inshalla! your
poor servant, too, will do his best. Let silence be called again."</p>

<p>It was necessary: for the entrance of the eunuch, the delivery of
the note, followed as they were by the withdrawal of Afzool Khan's
men, and some of the royal guard, had excited no little curiosity in
the assembly. Afzool Khan's absence had been regretted by some,
rejoiced in by others, but noticed by all; and now that his men
were sent away, the speculations that ensued were various as to the
cause; and while some feared disclosures, others already rejoiced in
the prospect of his possible disgrace.</p>

<p>"Khámôsh!" again was cried by the same voice, which rung
clearly above the buzz of conversation, and was taken up as before&mdash;"Khámôsh&mdash;silence!"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XLIII" id="CHAPTER_XLIII">CHAPTER XLIII.</a></h2>


<p>"O nobles, and well-wishers of the State!" cried the Secretary, in
a strong, manly voice, "it is not mere ceremony for which ye have
been called together this day; and it is not that the present urgent
matters might not be disposed of by the Shah&mdash;may his splendour
increase;&mdash;but in affairs of such moment, he would have the advice
and assistance of older men, and of those who, for years past, have
given their faith and their blood freely for the kingdom, and for his
family; and surely nothing need be done in private, when ye, O
Moslems! can be witnesses before God and the Prophet.</p>

<p>"Lo, friends in the faith! he hath called ye together because of
those grievous rumours of treachery which prevail: and because of
intrigues which have sown distrust between man and man in this
city. Of these, two have been revealed to him by means little short
of a miracle, and yet so true, that a child may understand them.
Hear, then, what my lord the King will say to ye&mdash;listen!"</p>

<p>A low murmur arose through the assembly as men spoke in short,
eager whispers to each other. Who was to be accused? To whom
did these introductory remarks refer in particular? Many a
secret traitor then sitting there, trembled upon his seat. Were he
denounced, he felt there would be no alternative between detection
and almost instant death, and there were not a few who repeated to
themselves the dying confession of faith. If it was to be, it was to
be; there was no escape now.</p>

<p>The King spoke from his seat, and though his voice was of a
gentler character than his Secretary's, its silvery ringing tones were
even more distinctly heard.</p>

<p>"O friends and subjects!" he said, "many words are hardly
needful when the understanding is to have clear scope for action,
and I desire all to consider what will be now put before ye. As
God hath appointed me His deputy on earth to govern this kingdom,
so I am answerable to Him for it, and for you, my people.
This I clearly admit. If it be glorious, are ye not so? If it be
tranquil, are ye not safe? If it be humbled, are ye not humbled
likewise? Is any one weary of our service, let him leave it, but for
the rest, let us be united: let it not be said by our enemies that we
could be seduced and divided, or that our foolish quarrels are worse
than the petty jealousies of the women of a divided house. O noble
Dekhanies, put enmity and treachery from among ye: is it come to
this, that they exist? Listen."</p>

<p>The King paused, and seemed to be searching under his cushions,
while the sounds of his last words, rising to the vaulted roof,
trembled in a sweet faint murmur, and died away among its fretted
recesses; and as yet the rapt silence of the assembly was unbroken.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p>"A man," he continued, holding up a mass of papers to the view
of all&mdash;"one whom we had venerated as a father&mdash;into whose hands
we were given by our father on his deathbed&mdash;has been false.
False to me, that is nothing,&mdash;false to the kingdom and to you, that
is more,&mdash;false to his oath to an orphan as I am, and to God, that is
most of all. Here is his writing, here are his seals,&mdash;look at them.
These letters to the Padshah Alumgeer began ere that bad man
were a king, and have been continued within a month; and by them
we read now, that him we speak of would have given away our
kingdom, but would have reserved his share. And yet, O Khan
Mahomed! if we wrong thee in this, we will do thee justice before
God and this assembly."</p>

<p>"Justice, justice!" echoed a thousand voices: "put out the
treason!" while many rose excitedly to their feet and were pulled
down again by their neighbours.</p>

<p>"Wait," continued the King. "Let him be heard in his own
behalf when he arrives; do not prejudge him. If these are untrue,
there is no honour we possess or can confer, that shall not be his.
If true, let the just Alla judge him before ye all."</p>

<p>"Ameen, ameen!" cried the Peer devoutly. "Ameen, ameen!"
was echoed by the assembly, in a hoarse roar, which filled the hall.
Again there was silence.</p>

<p>"The next is a more simple matter," continued the King, with
increased confidence. "Ye all know of Sivaji Bhóslay. How often
his father rebelled, and was punished, and again forgiven by our
father. How often the son hath been guilty of crimes. All these
would have been forgiven. As a wise father corrects, while he bears
with and forgives the errors of a wilful son,&mdash;so should we have forgiven
also; but for treachery. Look, friends, here, in the same
packet with those we have just mentioned, are these letters from
Sivaji to the Padshah. We who have fed this wolf, are his enemies;
those who have hunted him, are his friends. Here are lists of forts
which will be taken and held for the Moghuls, of districts to pay for
armies, of men who will join with their local levies. Between them
they will share the Dekhan, and Sivaji will be the imperial Vice-regent!</p>

<p>"Did ye hear, friends?" he continued, after a pause. "Do ye
desire to serve under the infidel? I am young. I have no experience.
I am a humble worm before God; but I am the son of one
who led ye to victory. I am one who has been nursed in war, and
will lead ye again! Choose, then, between them and the King of
your ancient dynasty. If I have a place in your hearts, bid me stay;
if not, a Durwaysh's robe and staff are mine, and at the blessed shrine
of the Prophet I will abjure the world and die. I will trouble ye no
more. No, no more&mdash;me, or mine."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p>For an instant the same sweet trembling murmur of the King's
voice arose to the roof&mdash;but for an instant only. As if with one
accord, a shout of "Deen! Deen! for the faith! for the faith! we
will die for you!"&mdash;rang through the building, as men, no longer
able to control their emotions, started to their feet and shouted the
war-cry of Islam. Those who were without had observed the emotion
in the hall, but had not been aware of its cause. Now, however,
the familiar battle-shout fell on willing ears, and was returned,
from the thousands gathered there, with an enthusiasm which knew
no bounds. "Deen! Deen!" accompanied by the battle-cries of the
various nobles and chiefs whose escorts were drawn up together.</p>

<p>Just then, and as the excitement from within and without had somewhat
subsided, a strong body of horse, known to all as belonging to
Afzool Khan, swept round the corner of the building with its standard
unfurled, and its kettle-drums beating loudly. Among the
serried mass of horsemen could be seen a palankeen closely muffled
and jealously guarded, immediately behind which rode the brave old
Khan and his son Fazil, with several of his officers. It was evident
to all that the litter contained a person of consequence; and many
from within the hall looked around anxiously, as Afzool Khan, his
son, and several others with him, dismounted and placed themselves
beside it. Could the Wuzeer have returned? If so, he was already
a prisoner, and there was no hope. If not, whom could it be? The
King had been about to address the assembly again, but he paused
and turned to those behind him.</p>

<p>"Ah," he cried exultingly, "Alla hath heard our prayers, and
here are our noble friends. I vow thank-offerings to thee, O Sofee
Surmust!<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> O Geesoo Duraz! by thy hands, Peer Sahib, as thou
wilt!"</p>

<p>"I said the planets assured me that my lord should destroy his
enemies to-day," said the Peer, wiping his eyes, for his love for Afzool
Khan was great, and he had feared seduction. "Shookr oolla!
Shookr oolla! Hazarha-Shookr! thousands of thanks do we offer at thy
throne, O merciful! and here he comes, Soobhán Ulla! Soobhán Ulla!"</p>

<p>Afzool Khan was well known, and a hearty shout had greeted him
as he dismounted, looked proudly about him, and returned the salutations
of his friends and the soldiery. The palankeen was, by his
orders, taken up the steps into the corridor; and, room being cleared
for it by the sticks and maces of the chobdars, it was carried on, the
Khan and his son accompanying it, through the entrance hall and
into the centre of the assembly before the throne, where, in spite of the
remonstrances of the chamberlains, it was set down. Then the Khan,
disengaging his sword from his belt, and bidding Fazil do the same,
they advanced to the foot of the musnud, and enveloping the hilts
in their scarfs, presented them as "nuzzurs" or offerings to the King,
making, at the same time, their customary obeisances.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>"Pardon for this boldness, my prince," said the Khan, "but as
the merciful Alla delivered us strangely out of his hands who is
there, we thought we had better bring him to 'the presence' at once."</p>

<p>"Who?" asked the king excitedly. "The Wuzeer? Khan
Mahomed?"</p>

<p>"No, my lord," returned the Khan, "but Jehándar Beg."</p>

<p>"God be praised thou art safe, Khan," returned the King, putting
out his hand and resting it upon the Khan's head, "and thou also,
Fazil. Now, we have no fear."</p>

<p>"Ah, old friend!" cried the Peer, the tears fairly running down
his cheeks while he pointed to the King; "he hath been so brave, so
brave: my boy&mdash;so eloquent. Stones would have cried out at his
words. Didst thou not hear the shouting?"</p>

<p>"Surely," returned the Khan; "but 'tis hardly a welcome sound
in these days unless one knows the reason, so we hurried on. Eloquent!
I knew he would be so. Brave! Ay, or he is no descendant of
his royal race. May I open the litter, my lord?" he asked of the King.</p>

<p>"Bismilla! open it," he replied; and some of the attendants
hastily untied the knots by which the cover had been fastened over
the top. As the last fold was removed, the figure of Jehándar Beg
sitting upright, his arms and hands swathed carefully in a shawl,
and his eyes bound with a handkerchief, was displayed to all. The
bandage was removed, and he looked wildly about him.</p>

<p>Jehándar Beg saw his position at once. He was no coward, and
he perceived that all chance of life had passed away. The Wuzeer
was not there, and Afzool Khan, stooping into the litter, took up the
case containing Jehándar Beg's most secret papers, and presented
them to the King. "May I be loosed?" said the Kótwal to the
Khan. "My fate is in the King's hands."</p>

<p>"Surely," replied the King; "we fear him not, nor any enemy,"
he continued, looking round. "May God deliver them into our hands,
even as he hath this traitor."</p>

<p>"Ameen! Ameen!" cried a tumult of voices, followed by the loud
Khámôsh of the criers.</p>

<p>Afzool Khan spoke so as to be heard by all. We need not follow
his recital, for the particulars have been already related; but the
words were drunk in with avidity by the assembly. He disclosed no
man's name; the papers would speak for themselves.</p>

<p>One by one they were read, Persian and Mahratta in turn, clearly
and distinctly; while, by the King's command, several of them were
taken round by mutsuddees to the principal nobles and sirdars, that
the seals might be examined.</p>

<p>This necessarily occupied some time, during which, the litter having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
been removed to the door, Jehándar Beg stood in the centre, as yet
boldly if not defiantly. Could the Wuzeer only arrive&mdash;and he was
expected momentarily&mdash;all would be changed. Before him the
King, bold as he seemed now, would quail; those friends in the assembly,
who had already exchanged glances with him, would at once
rise. There might be bloodshed, and of the result he had no doubt:
it had been calculated beforehand, and was certain. Much depended
on a mysterious arrangement of the Wuzeer's, which he suspected;
but to the particulars of which he had not been admitted. Need he
deny the papers? He dare not. They were facts which could
neither be denied nor evaded.</p>

<p>"Unhappy, godless man," cried the King, when several had been
read, and others were being examined, "are these true? Dost thou
admit them? Hast thou eaten my salt and found it so bitter, that
that of others seemed sweeter to thee? Speak, Jehándar Beg! are
these true? are they thine own?"</p>

<p>Upon his reply hung many a life had he chosen to denounce those
present; but with all his bad faith, there was no meanness in the man.</p>

<p>"The letters, my prince, are true; as they are addressed. I have
no more to say. Whatever my fate is to be, let it come; I am ready
to meet it," returned the Kótwal, firmly.</p>

<p>"And these for Khan Mahomed? The writing in the corner is
yours, and the date of receipt is to-day."</p>

<p>"It is my writing; why should I tell a lie?" returned Jehándar
Beg, sullenly; "but I know not the contents."</p>

<p>"Enough," replied the King; "my friends, we would do no injustice.
Let us await the Wuzeer's arrival&mdash;it cannot be long now&mdash;and
hear the result from his own lips."</p>

<p>"My lord, my prince," whispered the officer of the royal guard,
stepping behind the rail in an agitated manner, "be careful of yourself;
there is disturbance without; we will close round you; come
away. The Wuzeer&mdash;the Wuzeer is&mdash;is&mdash;dead&mdash;killed, they say&mdash;at
the outer gate as he entered. Withdraw with us&mdash;quick," said
the man excitedly; "the news is spreading fast."</p>

<p>"Who hath done this?" cried the King, starting to his feet, and
seizing his sword and shield, which, according to custom, lay before
him. "The Wuzeer is dead, they say. Is there aught to fear? I
move not, Afzool Khan, come what may. If I am to die, let it be
here, on my father's judgment-seat. Will ye bear me company?"</p>

<p>"To death, to death!" exclaimed Afzool Khan. "Who dare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
harm you? Ho! Alla-ool-Moolks, Bhylmees, Dâgtorays, all true
men present,&mdash;rally round the King," shouted the Khan. "Deen,
deen!" and his familiar battle-cry, "Futteh-i-Nubbee!" (Victory to
the Prophet) rang high above the hoarse murmur which had arisen
among the assembly. Now, however, those mentioned by the Khan
sprang to their feet by scores, and their example was followed by
hundreds. "Deen, Deen!" was shouted with increased enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"Here is one who brings particulars," said the Secretary, as an
officer was led in, who prostrated himself before the King.</p>

<p>"My lord, the Wuzeer is dead," said the man, sobbing bitterly.
"They murdered him at the gate. Those who did it went off across
the plain, but they were men who had ridden with him. I was
upon the bastion over the gate with a few others, and we saw them
come rapidly along the road from Allapoor. I knew my lord's
piebald horse, and his elephant was following at a little distance.
We watched him till he was near the gate; there were only a few of
us. There was no one present but a sentinel and one or two others,
and a Kullunder Fakeer had spread his carpet just within the walls,
and was crying, 'Ulla dilâyâ to léonga!' as passengers threw their
cowrees to him. We were descending the steps to present our nuzzurs,
when several of the men behind dragged the Wuzeer from his
horse, and others on foot, who had been running with him, killed him
with a hundred wounds ere he could cry out. What could we do,
my lord? Ere we could mount the bastion again the whole had dispersed.
We fired on them, but it was no use."</p>

<p>"And what became of the Fakeer?" asked the King, looking
towards the Secretary.</p>

<p>"My prince, he stayed with the body, and shut the eyes," replied
the man. "Then, as the Wuzeer's elephant arrived, he told the
driver to take up the dead, and we saw him go towards the mosque,
crying, as before, 'Ulla dilâyâ to léonga!' Hark!" he continued,
"there he is."</p>

<p>"Ulla dilâyâ to léonga! Ulla dilâyâ to léonga!" The cry came
nearer and nearer, never changing or faltering in its cadence or time&mdash;heard
above all other noises and confusion within and without&mdash;"Ulla
dilâyâ to léonga!"&mdash;up the steps, along the great corridor,
into the hall, where every one made way before the brawny form and
excited looks of the crier&mdash;who paused not, nor yet looked right or
left, till he reached the dais. Afzool Khan and Fazil would have
stopped him, but he strode on.</p>

<p>"Ulla dilâyâ to léonga!" he cried, looking at the King without
saluting him. "Khan Mahomed is dead, from a hundred wounds.
As I closed his eyes I saw this on the ground; it had fallen from
him, so I have brought it;" and flinging a case, containing papers,
to the King, he turned away without salutation; shouting the old,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
cry with his right arm bare, and stretched high above his head, he
strode out of the hall, continuing it as he passed out of the building
through the attendants and troops, and so away.</p>

<p>"Among these papers," said the Secretary, whispering to the
King, "are many which, if now disclosed, might make men desperate;
they are better kept secret."</p>

<p>"I am weary of them all," cried the King impatiently; "look at
the judgment of God; we should own it reverently."</p>

<p>"Zoolm! Zoolm!" (injustice!) cried a knot of men who had
collected at one side of the hall, and had risen from their seats. "Is
murder to be done, and pass unchallenged?" Their tone was fierce
and defiant, and boded no good.</p>

<p>"Peace, O friends!" cried Afzool Khan, stretching out his hands
to them. "Is this a time for strife? who can say by whose hands
he died? Yet better dead, than for this guilt to be proved before
all, by these witnesses&mdash;his own hand and seals. O friends, brothers
in the faith! there is the throne we have to defend, and we should
count it holy martyrdom to die before it. We are ready; will ye be
tardy?"</p>

<p>"Deen, Deen! listen to Afzool Khan! Futteh-i-Nubbee!" (Victory
to the Prophet) the Khan's battle-cry, was shouted with deafening
clamour. "Death to the unbelievers!"</p>

<p>"Silence, friends!" cried the Peer, as there was a short cessation
of the shouting; "listen to me. One traitor is dead, but are we
less than men that we permit Sivaji Bhóslay, his accomplice, to
defile our beards? Deen, Deen! cry to God for victory. Deen,
Deen!" he continued, rising and raising his voice to a shrill scream,
as he stretched out his arms, "the Prophet hears us, and Ali, and
the holy martyrs, and so will ye be martyrs and enjoy paradise if ye
die."</p>

<p>Again, again his cry was raised, the fanatical cry of Islam, which
no Moslem can hear without emotion; and grave men hitherto
unmoved, roused with the rest to frantic enthusiasm by the holy
man's words, threw themselves on each other's necks and wept
aloud.</p>

<p>"And now, friends," continued the King, when he could be heard,
"let him who would punish Sivaji Bhóslay for a thousand crimes
and treacheries, take up the gage I place here. In the name of God
and the Prophet, let who will take it, I accept him;" and so saying
he motioned to an attendant, who, bringing forward a salver covered
with a brocaded cloth, set it down on the edge of the dais before the
King, and uncovered it.</p>

<p>On the salver lay a single birra of Pân, covered with gold leaf,
one of those which, on the conclusion of the ceremony, would be
distributed by thousands. Who would take it up?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>"Are ye laggards, my friends, in pursuit of honour? I thought
yonder gage would be a mark for men to strive for; are ye laggards,
O faithful?" cried the Peer.</p>

<p>The mass&mdash;for every one had risen to his feet&mdash;swayed to and fro
with emotion, but no one advanced; and out of it issued the hoarse
ominous murmur that had several times arisen, and which, in the
absence of any decisive action, caused involuntary apprehension.</p>

<p>At this moment Afzool Khan stepped boldly forward, and taking
up the gage, pressed it to his forehead, eyes, and lips, then, saluting
the King, held it high above his head for all to see.</p>

<p>"My prince, it is mine," he said, "if it be permitted, and if these
my friends will join me."</p>

<p>"Ye have heard," said the King, turning to the assembly, "I
accept him."</p>

<p>It was the crowning point of the ceremony, and the people, no
longer withheld by court etiquette, swayed forward to the foot of
the dais with tumultuous shouts of joy. Those without only knew
that war had been proclaimed, and their cries mingled hoarsely
with the rest.</p>

<p>"It is well this should cease, my lord," said the Secretary. "Men's
hearts are hot, and enough hath been done to-day."</p>

<p>"Good," replied the King, "let the criers proclaim the Burkhast;
and that there will be preaching in the Jumma Mosque daily, at
noon, till the army advances."</p>

<p>"Be that my care," said the Peer, "and their hearts shall be
kept hot, I promise you."</p>

<p>It was done. Attendants went round with trays of Pân, reserving
Utr and other sweet essences for those privileged to receive
them. The King sat to the last, and the great Hall was gradually
emptied, save of the royal guards,&mdash;Afzool Khan and his son,&mdash;Alla
ool Moolk, and other nobles, who had been desired to remain.
The Kótwal's fate was yet in suspense.</p>

<p>"Bring forward Jehándar Beg," cried the King to the officer of
the guard; and the prisoner was again conducted to the front of
the dais, around which the nobles were now grouped. He saw no
hope in those stern, pitiless faces.</p>

<p>"See what that case of papers contains, Meerza Sahib," said the
King; "there should be no mistake in this matter."</p>

<p>"There is no need," said the Kótwal, sullenly, to the King. "If
you had died to-day, those who brought me here would ere now
have been headless corpses. I will answer no more questions. Do
with me as you will; except in prayer, my lips open no more."</p>

<p>"Take him away to death," said the King. "A kingdom that
never punishes is too weak to exist."</p>

<p>Jehándar Beg was led away through the private cloisters. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
head had fallen upon his bosom; but those who saw it never forgot
the fire which seemed to flash from his large eyes, and the scowl
of deadly hate which he cast upon all around him as he walked
firmly on.</p>

<p>"We may now separate," said the King. "Forgive me, O friends,
who have as yet known me only as a boy playing about your knees,
if I have acted weakly in this first rough lesson of life. O noble
Khan, there are those who await you with tears of joy. What
can I say for this service you have done? This sword is known
to you; wear it for the sake of Adil Khan. And do thou, Fazil
Khan, take these, the first marks of honour thou hast won; but,
Inshalla! not the last;" and removing the costly jewel from his
turban, and a heavy necklace of pearls from his neck, he invested
the young man with them with his own hands.</p>

<p>"I have but one boon to ask, my prince," said Fazil; "it is for
my friend, the Wuzeer's son. I will answer for him with my life,
that he was as true as I am. May I console him?"</p>

<p>"Take this to him," said the King, removing a gold ring from
his wrist; "tell him that from Adil Shah he need fear nothing."</p>

<p>"Altogether," said our friend the Lalla, who had accompanied
the Khan and Fazil, "these Dekhanies have some method in their
rudeness; but, after all, they are mad,&mdash;quite mad. Such ebullitions
of temper could not have been allowed in the Padshah's court.
Mobaruk, mobaruk bâd, Khan Sahib," he cried, heartily yet respectfully,
to Afzool Khan and Fazil, as they were passing out and
receiving the warm greetings of their friends,&mdash;and of all, high and
low, who could reach them,&mdash;"let your poor servant be honoured
by his congratulation being accepted."</p>

<p>"Ah, friend, art thou there?" replied the Khan. "Well, thou
must be seen to; come to my house and we will arrange something
for thee."</p>

<p>"May it please my lord to make me news-writer to his army,"
cried the Lalla, joining his hands. "My style, Inshalla!&mdash;is&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well," said Afzool Khan, interrupting him good-humouredly.
"Son, wilt thou have him?"</p>

<p>"I agree, father," said Fazil, smiling, "if he will serve under one
who may, after all, be only a Gosai."</p>

<p>"I am my lord's slave to death. I am but a poor Khayet, but
I can be of use to a discerning patron," returned the Lalla.</p>

<p>"Come, son," said the Khan, "let us see whether Kowas Khan be
returned. The King's message should be delivered ere we proceed
home. Methinks he and all his people would be safer with us for
a few days, until men's minds are calmer."</p>

<p>We will not follow the Khan on his benevolent errand; nor can
we detail how much mustard and coriander seed were burned with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
frankincense before them to avert evil when they reached home: nor
yet how often Goolab, and the other women-servants, and even the
lady Lurlee herself, cracked their knuckles over them, till they would
crack no more. One thing, however, was certain: the worthy lady
was more than ever assured that she had read the planets aright, and,
if she had not done so, a great evil would have befallen the family.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XLV" id="CHAPTER_XLV">CHAPTER XLV.</a></h2>


<p>Somewhat later in the day, a few groups of men were assembled
near those majestic Adansonian trees which still stand by the wayside
between the Citadel and the outer gate of the fort of Beejapoor.
The sun's rays fell slanting through their dense foliage, and cast
broad shadows upon the bright green sward, which, with the trees
themselves, glowed in the evening light. The wind had fallen, and
not a leaf stirred in the oppressive sultry calm which prevailed.</p>

<p>On one side, upon piece of faded carpet, torn and ragged, sat
a Fakeer, to all appearance, with long matted hair streaming over
his shoulders to his waist, and over his face also, so as partly to
conceal it. Some coarse rags hung loosely about him, but he wore
the tall felt cap of the Kullunders, and their quilted robe thrown
over his shoulders. He sat upon his heels, leaning upon a bright
steel rod with prongs at the end, which might serve either for
support or defence, and spoke to no one; but now and again a low
cry of "Ulla dilâyâ to léonga," was rather muttered than cried
aloud. A few copper coins and cowries, which had been thrown to
him by passers-by, lay on the carpet.</p>

<p>At a little distance from him were two parties of armed men&mdash;some
Mussulmans, some Hindus&mdash;standing, lounging on the grass,
and speaking carelessly together. One of these, from his dress and
hair, seemed to be of more pretension than the rest, and might be
the Jemadar, or sub-officer of the party, and was attended by two
men armed with "Puttas," long, broad Toledo blades, set in steel
gauntlets inlaid with silver, which hung at their backs, the hilts
projecting over their shoulders. These men were both short, with
round backs, and very powerful frames; and, from this brief
description, our previous acquaintance with them under the banian
tree will be remembered.</p>

<p>"Perhaps they have pardoned him, after all, and let him go," said
Rama. "The King is young, and soft as a woman; and what will
the uncle yonder say to that, I wonder?"</p>

<p>"Impossible," replied Lukshmun; "I was behind the guards all
the time, and heard Jehándar Beg ordered for execution under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
Goruk Imlee. No, the King was as firm as our uncle when&mdash;&mdash;Look!
what is that? Can it be they?"</p>

<p>As he spoke, a small procession was seen approaching, a litter
tied up as though a lady were within; a few footmen ran beside it,
and a few horsemen rode before and behind. Unobtrusive in
character, its movements were nevertheless followed with the
greatest interest by the men we have mentioned, and even the
Fakeer looked aside to watch it.</p>

<p>At first it seemed to be proceeding by the road in the direction of
the outer gate; but as it arrived opposite the trees, the leading
horsemen turned suddenly across the sward and halted under them,
followed by the bearers, who at once hastily put down the litter
and retired apart. The leader of the party drew up his own men at
a little distance, while the footmen were directed to remove the
cover of the litter. As they did so, the person within, who was
pinioned, put his feet out of it, and stood up.</p>

<p>"Where is Hoosein, the executioner?" cried the officer; "he was
ordered to be here; and this is no time for delay. Have any of ye
seen him?" he asked of the people around.</p>

<p>Some one answered, "He is not here;" and another cried carelessly,
"Hoosein does not like doing service for his own master;"
and a third called out sneeringly, "You will find him drunk in the
bazar by this time; go and look there."</p>

<p>"God forbid," said the officer, impatiently; "go, some of you,
and see if he be coming in any direction;" and several of the
horsemen dashed off at full speed.</p>

<p>"Enough, sir," said Jehándar Beg, sadly; "a keen sword is all
that is needed; and ye are soldiers. Loose my hands, I pray ye,
that I may say my last prayer before I die.... Peace for a while.
Syn," he continued to the Fakeer, whose chant had increased to a
solemn wail; "here is something for thee. See thou to my grave,
and to the Fatehas after death. This will be enough, perhaps,"
he continued, with a sad smile, throwing some gold coins to the
man, which lighted upon his carpet, but were not noticed.</p>

<p>"Ulla dilâyâ to léonga!" was the only reply; but the tone,
which had been raised as Jehándar Beg appeared, now subsided
into a low murmur.</p>

<p>"Let it be here," said Jehándar Beg, stepping forward to a piece
of smooth turf under one of the huge branches. "Will any one
lend me a scarf? Stay, this will do," he continued, loosing his own
shawl from his waist; "when I am dead, give it to the Durwaysh
yonder." Then he spread it out on the ground, and knelt down
upon it, with his face towards Mecca, settling the cap upon his
head, smoothing his long curly beard, and the glossy brown curls
which fell upon his neck. "There is no use asking for water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
for ablution," he muttered, "this will suffice;" and taking up a
little dry earth, he rubbed his hands with it, allowing the dust to
fall over his elbows.</p>

<p>Jehándar Beg looked once more around ere he began his prayer;
above, to the stately trees, and their heavy foliage, among which
a flock of noisy parroquets were fluttering from branch to branch,
and screaming loudly; over the green sward, to the King's fort
and palaces, on which, and upon the noble dome of the mausoleum
of Mahmood Adil Shah, his first benefactor and patron, the mellow
light of evening rested in a golden radiance, and away over trees,
gardens, and minarets, all glowing in the same soft beauty; then upon
the group around him, for a few chance passengers, seeing what was
to happen, had gathered round the spot.</p>

<p>A shiver seemed to pass through him as he closed his eyes slowly.
Not of fear, for the man, a Fatalist by creed and habit, was meeting
his doom stoically as a brave Moslem can do; but a thought had
crossed him which would not be put back&mdash;a vision of love and peace&mdash;of
his girl wife in her rosy beauty, and of her fair boy, far away
at his own village and home, in the blue mountains of Khorassan&mdash;and
of a fond aged mother who lived with them. This season they
were to have come to him. Who now would tell them of his fate?</p>

<p>"A word, Jemadar," he said to the officer. "Bid that Fakeer
come hither."</p>

<p>"Thou wilt do it," he said, as the man rose and advanced, "for
the sake of the gold. Give this ring to Afzool Khan&mdash;my worst
enemy in life, and yet the truest man in Beejapoor&mdash;and these papers;
he will know what to write to my&mdash;my&mdash;to my house. And now,
friends, peace, and the peace of God and the love of the Prophet be
with ye! When I have said the prayer, I would die."</p>

<p>It was finished, but as yet no executioner had arrived. Jehándar
Beg sat resting upon his heels, his eyes closed, while his beads passed
rapidly through his fingers as his lips moved in prayer.</p>

<p>"We cannot delay," cried the Jemadar to those around, "will
none of ye strike a blow for the King? Here is the warrant, and
here is a bag of money for any who will earn it."</p>

<p>"Go thou, Rama," said Lukshmun, nudging his brother, "thou
art a surer hand with the 'Putta' than I am; but if thou wilt not, I
will try mine on that rascal, who hath strung up many a better fellow
than himself on these trees. Hast thou forgotten what he did to
our people?"</p>

<p>"Yes," added Gopal Singh; "go, Rama, and end this play. See
thou do it well, and they will give thee the money. Go!"</p>

<p>"If the uncle wills it," said Rama, hitching forward his long
weapon, as he looked for a moment to the Fakeer, who bowed his
head, imperceptibly to others, yet intelligibly to them, as he repeated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
his cry. "Yes, I will do it," and drawing the broad blade, on which
the sun's rays flashed brightly, he felt its edge, then put his hand
into the gauntlet which reached to his elbow, and fastened the straps
over his wrist and arm carefully. He now advanced lightly, with
circling steps, flourishing the heavy weapon, as though it had been
a stick, round and round his head; yet, with every sweep, it was
clear that he was measuring his distance more carefully. Another
moment&mdash;a bright flash in the air&mdash;a whistling sound as the sword
clove it&mdash;and the head of Jehándar Beg rolled to the ground, the lips
still moving with the prayer which he had not finished, while the
trunk fell forward quivering.</p>

<p>"The second to-day," said Rama, muttering to himself, as he wiped
his sword on the sward. "Enough, enough!"</p>

<p>"Soobhán Ulla!" exclaimed the Jemadar. "A brave stroke.
Thou shouldst be chief executioner thyself, friend."</p>

<p>"That is my brother, noble sir," said Lukshmun, interrupting the
speaker, "and he does not like being spoken to after he has cut off a
man's head. Give me the money, Jemadar Sahib, and let us begone;
you see he is cleaning his sword; he might dirty it again if he were
vexed."</p>

<p>"Take it, friend," returned the officer, "and away with ye, for
yonder is Hoosein Jullâd coming, and ye may perchance quarrel
over it. Begone!"</p>

<p>"Bid him and his party watch here till I bring men to bury the
dead," said the seeming Fakeer, who had again risen and advanced,
and who, having removed the bloody shawl, was rolling it up. "Watch
with them, even though it should be night. This gold will suffice for
all, and I will return." So saying, he stalked away rapidly in the direction
of the fort, while his strange cry changed&mdash;"Ulla dilâyâ to leea,
Ulla dilâyâ to leea!" (God gave and I took, God gave and I took!)</p>

<p>"Sir, here are the executioner's men, and they will watch; we
need not stay," said one of the soldiers to their officer. "Let us go."</p>

<p>The litter was taken up, the soldiers moved rapidly away, and
there remained only the watchers and two women, wrapped closely
in heavy sheets, who had not been previously noticed, and who
sat cowering behind one of the giant trunks, sobbing bitterly. Perhaps&mdash;&mdash;;
but no matter now.</p>

<p>The sun was sinking fast, and its rays fell upon a pool of blood,
glistening, as it dried among the blades of the close sward,&mdash;upon a
ghastly head, its face turned upwards to the sky,&mdash;and a headless
trunk beside it, from which the crimson stream was still oozing.
Above, on the high bare branches, sat foul birds and ravens, which
had already scented the blood, and whose hoarse croaks mingled with
the heavy rustle of the wings of vultures, assembling for a night
feast;&mdash;no unusual matter, perhaps, in that place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"A Fakeer says he must see you, my lord," said Goolab to Afzool
Khan, as he sat quietly in his accustomed seat after the evening
prayer. "He is in the court at the door, and will take no denial. He
will not go away, but cursed frightfully when we said you were tired,
and were resting in private."</p>

<p>"A Fakeer, Goolab! Do you know him?"</p>

<p>"All he says, master, is 'Ulla dilâyâ to leea,'" replied the woman,
"and he declared he would cut himself with a knife and throw his
blood upon us if we did not tell you. Hark! there is a shout."</p>

<p>"Ulla dilâyâ to leea!"</p>

<p>The Khan did not delay. "I know him, Goolab," he said. "Go,
and say I come."</p>

<p>"Bid every one depart hence," said the man as Afzool Khan
approached him, attended by several servants. "What I have to say
to thee brooks no listeners. There," he continued, when all had
gone; and flinging down the bloody scarf at the Khan's feet, "look,
it is his blood who would have been true, but for him who went to
hell before him. Here is his last request to thee, Afzool Khan, for
he trusted thee only, of all this city. Take them, I have done his
last bidding."</p>

<p>"His seal and these papers, Syn. More treason, perhaps. Did
he say aught of them?" said the Khan.</p>

<p>"Only that they belonged to his house, and I should give them to
you; and he died like a brave man as he was."</p>

<p>"Yes, as he was, Syn," echoed the Khan sadly&mdash;"as he was. And
thou hast buried him? Else&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I have cared for that; it doth not concern thee, Khan."</p>

<p>"And who art thou, Syn? We have met before to-day."</p>

<p>"Ay, Khan, and before that often. Am I safe with thee? Put
thy hand on my head; nay, fear not a poor servant of God, and I
will tell thee who I am."</p>

<p>"Surely, friend," replied Afzool Khan, putting out his hand upon
the high felt cap, "fear not."</p>

<p>"Not there, not there; on my head," cried the man, grasping the
Khan's hand, and kissing it while he removed the cap; "on my head,
on my head. Ask Ali Adil Shah of me, and remember&mdash;Pahar
Singh."</p>

<p>"Pahar Singh!" exclaimed the Khan, starting back.</p>

<p>"Hush, fear not; I have been pardoned, and the Shah's hand hath
been before thine on his head; fear not, I will be true to thee, for
thou art faithful to him. Thy hand once more, Khan, freely and
truly upon my head."</p>

<p>"Go, friend," said Afzool Khan, placing it as he desired. "Go, I
doubt thee not, for I have heard what happened last night; go in
peace. Whatever thou canst do for the Shah will not be forgotten."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p>"There is yet one more work to-day ere I sleep, Khan&mdash;one more,
and I go to do it. God be with you."</p>

<p>As he departed, the men on guard would have stopped him, but
again the old cry arose, and in his assumed character no one molested
him, as the shout, rising and falling on the air, died away in the far
distance.</p>

<p>Afzool Khan took up the bloody scarf and gave it to an attendant.
"Let it be washed, and kept till I ask for it," he said. Not long
afterwards some Persian merchants were returning to their country,
and they bore the last requests of the unhappy Jehándar Beg, with
such monies as could be saved out of his property, to his family.</p>

<p>That evening the crypt under the old tomb was again empty.
Maloosray's scouts had brought him the news of Bulwunt Rao having
survived his wound; and of the occurrences in the Durbar of the King,
of which he had been advised by the Brahmun we have seen in
communication with Jehándar Beg. Watching from the terrace of
the temple, he had seen the Wuzeer's arrival at Allapoor; followed
his course across the plain; and guessed, by the confusion and shots
at the gate, and the dispersion of the horsemen with him, that something
extraordinary had taken place, the particulars of which, and
of the subsequent execution of Jehándar Beg, were related by his
scouts. Under the presence of Pahar Singh, therefore, Beejapoor
was no longer safe; and as night closed, the whole party, unobserved,
left their hiding-place to its usual tenants, the jackals and hyenas of
the plain.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XLVI" id="CHAPTER_XLVI">CHAPTER XLVI.</a></h2>


<p>As night fell, and as Maloosray knew all the Mahomedans would be
engaged in their evening prayer, his little party emerged from the
crypt, and took their way westward across the plain, avoiding the
suburbs, and threading the narrow lanes among the fields, which on
all sides skirted the city. One by one his followers and scouts had
been despatched in advance to meet them at certain places; and a
spot known to all, where the great northern and western roads
diverged, was fixed upon as a final place of rendezvous. Thither,
also, had been despatched the wounded man, Ranojee, who, unable
to ride far at a time, was to proceed by easy stages with the scouts
and other servants to Jutt, the chieftain of which town was a
sincere adherent to their cause.</p>

<p>Maloosray himself, taking Nettajee, and the chief scout Ramjee
with two others, to serve as grooms, had determined to visit Tooljapoor
before he returned to his master. There were many active<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
partisans of weight in the Bâlâ Ghaut; what had they determined
upon, and what was his old friend Jeswunt Rao Bhóslay of Sindphul
doing? It was impossible to write, and as long as personal
communication can be insured, Mahrattas never write letters. It
was above all things necessary that Moro Trimmul and Jeswunt
Rao must have the first news of the Wuzeer's death; and except it
were reported by royal express to the camp at Nuldroog, it could
hardly be known at Tooljapoor next day. It was a long ride,
certainly, but it was possible to reach Tooljapoor, and to secure
Moro Trimmul's safety, in case it should be threatened.</p>

<p>The occurrences at Beejapoor had been very unexpected by
Maloosray. At first sight they appeared to be a sore discouragement
to the plans which had been almost matured; and for some
time he rode in silence, brooding over the catastrophe we have
recorded. He could not account for it. To all appearance the
King and the Wuzeer had been on excellent terms, and Jehándar
Beg their confidant; yet in one day both had been destroyed, and
the party of Afzool Khan had suddenly become the leading one in
the State. Was he ambitious, he might be prime minister. In his
heart Maloosray acknowledged his fitness for the post. No other
person would command the allegiance of the army, with whom
Khan Mahomed had not been popular. "It will unite in the Khan,
and we shall have enough to do to escape it," he thought, "but the
young tree will bend to the storm when the old one will break, and
we may find opportunity to strengthen ourselves, while we do not
weaken the royal house."</p>

<p>Now the moon shone out brightly. There had been no rain since
the storm of the previous night. The day had been hot and sultry;
but as the night fell, a delicious breeze, soft and cool, had succeeded
the calm of the evening, and the road was sufficiently dry to be
travelled without inconvenience. Maloosray's noble mare seemed
to feel, with her master, the invigorating effects of freedom of
action,&mdash;and her light and springy movements, which conveyed to
the rider an involuntary assurance of activity and endurance, excited
within him a more hopeful spirit than that with which he had
quitted the city. Now and again, as they passed some muddy
rivulet, or stony portion of the road, a word of encouragement
or caution from her rider would be answered by a low whinny,
which was followed by a loving caress of her arched neck, and thus
a perfect accordance seemed to be established between them.</p>

<p>"Shall we reach the river before daylight, Sidda," said Maloosray
to his guide; "and can we get the boat? Will it be on this
side?"</p>

<p>"The boatmen are all friends of mine, master," replied the man,
"and will cross me at any village or at any time; fear not, I will say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
I have dispatches, and they believe in this stick that I am on the
royal service. No one will dare to stop one of the royal Hurkaras
with this as his warrant;" and as he spoke he flourished the weapon&mdash;a
short stout staff, gaily lacquered in rings of red, yellow, and
black, with a heavy tuft of black cotton yarn at the end, from
whence projected a formidable four-sided lance about a foot long,
the point of which was carefully sharpened&mdash;lightly round his
head.</p>

<p>They rode on, keeping the main track; now and again passing
villages, where they were saluted by a chorus of barks and howls
from the village dogs; again traversing long intervals between
others, where the occasional piping of sleepless plovers, the wailing
cries of ever-wakeful restless lapwings, and an occasional burst of
howls and screams from packs of wandering jackals,&mdash;were the only
sounds which fell on their ears in those solitudes.</p>

<p>They met no one at that hour, but they did not pass the villages,
lying upon the road, unremarked. Here a shrill challenge was
blown upon a horn as they passed a gate; there a drum was beaten,
and other indications given of the village watch being on the alert,
or a shot was fired from a bastion or watch-tower, the bullet of
which sung harmlessly above their heads into the air. They were
rough times those, when men ploughed with their fire-arms slung
at their backs, and when the village cattle, while grazing, had to be
guarded by parties of matchlock men against the raids of more
powerful neighbours.</p>

<p>The moon set soon after midnight, and the wind again arose,
sighing as it swept across the broad plains in fitful gusts, or rustling
among the tall fields of grain which bordered the road. Light
clouds, too, were rising from the westward, and hurrying across the
face of the sky, partly obscured the stars, and caused additional
gloom. Under other guidance Maloosray would have felt uncertain
of the path; but the Hurkara never diverted from the track, or
slackened his pace; and the party passed on unnoticed, at the
greatest speed that the light and the road would admit of, without
distressing their horses.</p>

<p>As they ascended one of the long undulating eminences, which
are the characterizing features of the country, and which commanded
a view for some miles around, Maloosray's attention
was attracted by a light which, emerging from behind some grain
fields from another direction, was advancing rapidly towards
them, and apparently would cross the road a little in advance of
them. It was evidently a torch, possibly that of some travellers;
yet it moved too swiftly and regularly for men on foot; and to the
keen practised ear of Maloosray himself, as well as of his followers,
the tread of a body of horse was heard, while the slight occasional<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
sparkles from weapons, and the dull red glow of matches, were soon
distinctly visible.</p>

<p>Could they have been followed? Had any one remarked their
departure from the city? The little party halted at once, and drew
up out of the track of the road to escape observation, and watched
the movement of the light before them with beating hearts. Nor
were they long in suspense. After disappearing for a moment in a
hollow, the light appeared again upon the road itself, and the body
of horse, which might be fifty or more, drew up across their way
and halted.</p>

<p>Who could they be? Certain it was that the party was now
posted there to waylay some one who was expected, and the information
they were acting upon was apparently as sure as their
movements were methodical. Not a neigh escaped their horses,
nor was there any commotion apparently among the men. The
place chosen was admirably adapted for a surprise. The road, as
we have said, led up a slight ascent or spur of an undulation, the
sides of which broke into small but rough ravines and watercourses
intermixed with large loose boulders of basalt, difficult to be traversed
on horseback even by day, and quite impassable by night.
These features were the same on both sides; and the spur itself was
a narrow neck, which widened, as the plain above stretched out,
into one of the usual broad expanses of waste and cultivated lands.</p>

<p>"They have come by Hórtee," said the Hurkara in a whisper&mdash;"the
village there in the hollow&mdash;and are waiting for some one.
Master, dost thou fear them?&mdash;they will hardly molest travellers
such as we are. Shall we go on?"</p>

<p>It was a difficult point to decide. There was certainly no way of
avoiding them and yet keeping the road.</p>

<p>"Go, Ramjee," said Maloosray to his scout; "go and see who
they are. Be careful! my mind misgives me about them."</p>

<p>"Master," replied the man, "this ground is higher than theirs,
and if they put out the light they will see thee against the sky.
Retire a little lower, and Enkôba and I will find it all out for you."</p>

<p>Maloosray saw the intelligence of the advice, and acted promptly
upon it, while the two men, well accustomed to such proceedings,
crept warily along under cover of bushes and inequalities, of the
ground, till they entered a tall field of grain, in which they could
move without chance of observation up to the very party itself, and
from which they looked with safety upon the horsemen.</p>

<p>As they had supposed, the body was drawn up across the road.
One flank overlapped the corn-field, on the path by which they had
come; the other rested upon a declivity where the same path descended
to the westward. It was clear that the position could not
be turned without great risk, and it was impossible to say whether
the path to Hórtee might not be guarded also.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>In front of the party, and near a man who held a torch which he
replenished with oil from time to time, were two persons mounted
on powerful horses, whose wet coats and panting flanks showed that
they had been ridden at a rapid rate; and it was also evident from
the condition of the rest, splashed with mud and with similar
evidences of fatigue, that, whatever might be the object, speed had
not been spared in its pursuit.</p>

<p>"They cannot pass this unobserved," said the elder of the two,
"and there can be no suspicion that we are on this road. Ah, there
is no such trap, boy, in the country, not a rat could get by it. Well,
we have not been idle; first Khan Mahomed, second the Kótwal, and
now Maloosray and his friend Nettajee."</p>

<p>"You have not got them yet," thought Ramjee, "and Tannajee is
not game for you, old fox. But for him, my dagger would have
made acquaintance with you that day in the Gosai's Mutt at Tooljapoor.
Ah! who could have told him of us?"</p>

<p>"I think, uncle, we had as well put out the torch," said a man,
coming forward, riding a tall grey mare. "Tannajee is not a moth
to fly into a candle."</p>

<p>"Good, Lukshmun," said the chief; "put it out."</p>

<p>"I think we were wrong, father," said the other leader; "a few
men would have surrounded that den under the tomb, and no one
could have escaped."</p>

<p>"True; but you would not have taken Tannajee alive, and here he
will be helpless. No, it is better as it is; and he shall sit under the
Goruk Imlees, and die like Jehándar Beg, before me."</p>

<p>"And Rama shall help him on his way to the gods, master, if you
like," said Lukshmun. "He says he is quite ready, and he got the
Putta sharpened again."</p>

<p>"Silence!" said the chief, as the light was extinguished, "not a
word must be spoken now, nor a horse stir. Be careful, all of ye."</p>

<p>The scouts had seen and heard enough. The rustling of the high
corn-stalks and their leaves, under the breeze, prevented their return
through them being heard, and in a few moments they had rejoined
Maloosray, who, with Nettajee, had descended the brow of the ascent
for a few paces, and could not be seen from above.</p>

<p>"Master," whispered the scout, "'tis the Old Lion, Pahar Singh,
and his cub, Gopal, and their men. I saw one of the hunchbacks,
too, with them."</p>

<p>"Ha! the Old Lion thinks to have a feast to-day, Nettajee," said
Maloosray, "but the man is yet to be born who will take Tannajee
alive. And what did he say, Ramjee?"</p>

<p>"He said you should be taken alive, and that you should sit under
the Goruk Imlees, and have your head cut off, like Jehándar Beg, by
Rama the hunchback."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah," said Tannajee, "he should not have brought a torch with
him, Netta, else it was not ill-contrived. By the Holy Mother, there
had been small chance for us had we got among them. And now,
what is to be done?"</p>

<p>"We must go back. Beyond the rivulet and the date grove
yonder is a path which leads to Boorga, and so to Churchan, if my lord
does not care for a few coss more," said the Hurkara; "and, after
all, it is as near as any other road to Mundroop."</p>

<p>"Good," said Tannajee; "let us be quick, they may advance."</p>

<p>So they moved carefully down the descent, beyond which was a
small rivulet bordered by thin date trees and other brushwood.
"See," said Netta, as they crossed the small stream, "we are but just
in time: there they are!" and as Tannajee looked up, he saw several
figures projected in outline against the sky, one of whom was pointing
to the road leading to Beejapoor.</p>

<p>"I thought the Old Lion had been more wary," he said, "than to
show himself in that manner; but he may cool his heart now; he had
better have made for the ferry!"</p>

<p>It had, however, been a narrow escape, and one for which Tannajee
vowed to feed a hundred Brahmuns at Tooljapoor; but the
danger was past, and after a somewhat rough track for a short distance
westward, the guide struck confidently into a broader road,
which, like the preceding, led northwards, and, as the day dawned,
the river-bank at the ferry beyond Churchan was safely reached. The
guide's staff of office proved irresistible. In a few moments they were
seated in one of the large circular coracle baskets of wicker-work,
covered with hide, which serve as ferry-boats; and with the two
mares swimming in front, and guided by the men who held them,
and the skilful paddles of three lusty rowers, the party crossed the
stream, and were beyond danger of pursuit.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XLVII" id="CHAPTER_XLVII">CHAPTER XLVII.</a></h2>


<p>In his last letter to Beejapoor, Moro Trimmul had directed his agent
there to inform Maloosray that, at the day of which we write, there
would be recitations in the temple, and, under cloak of this, that
most of the heads of the Mahratta families were to assemble; it
would, therefore, be advisable if he could meet them. It was partly
on this account, but most particularly because of the murder of
Khan Mahomed, that Tannajee had left the city so abruptly, and
ridden through the night without a check.</p>

<p>Nor did Tannajee and his companion take rest anywhere during
the day following, except for such refreshment as was absolutely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
necessary. They avoided all large towns and villages; and, as
Tannajee knew the country perfectly by day, he guided his friend by
cross paths, frequently through fields and waste lands, till, as the
evening fell, they drew up before the gate of Sindphul, the village
below the pass of Tooljapoor, which we have before had occasion to
mention.</p>

<p>The owner, a distant relative of the Rajah Sivaji, by name
Jeswunt Rao Bhóslay, was an intimate friend of Maloosray's, and a
true and influential ally of the general cause in those districts.
Maloosray's sudden arrival surprised him little, for in consequence of
what Moro Trimmul had written, he had been expected; and, after a
short conference, Maloosray urged that the news he had brought
should be communicated to Moro Trimmul and those assembled with
as little delay as possible, and in this Jeswunt Rao concurred.</p>

<p>So, after a slight rest and hearty meal, which both needed, the
stout ponies, provided by their host, were announced to be ready in
the courtyard of the house, and, accompanied by half-a-score of stout
sword-and-buckler men, with matchlocks and lighted matches, they
rode out of the village gate.</p>

<p>The active ponies, though well accustomed to the rough mountain-road,
had paused for a moment to take breath on the level spot from
whence the buildings could be seen below&mdash;the glare of light, spreading
up both sides of the dell, revealing crag and rough wood, with
the gilded pinnacles of the temple glittering brightly through the
smoke of torches and of incense; but their impatient riders again
urged them up the rocky ascent with all the speed they were capable
of exciting. At the town gate there was no hindrance, for Jeswunt
Rao was well known; so they were admitted without difficulty, and,
leaving the animals at a house which belonged to him, adjoining the
main street, the party proceeded at once in the direction of the
temple.</p>

<p>It was no easy matter, however, to get there. As they approached
the gate at the head of the steps descending into the ravine, and on
the steps themselves, the crowds were almost impassable, but good-humour
prevailed, and, after some struggles, the lower court and the
great assembly were safely reached.</p>

<p>It was a remarkable sight. The court itself was crowded with
spectators so closely packed that to move was impossible. They were
sitting upon the paved floor in rows facing the centre, where an open
space had been provided for the priests, and an avenue left for their
communication with the shrine. Around this the most distinguished
of the guests had been placed; and Maloosray observed with satisfaction,
that many influential persons whom he desired to see, were
present. So far, his visit could not have been better timed.</p>

<p>All round the court were huge cressets of iron, fixed into brackets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
in the walls and arches of the court. These were filled with cotton-seed
which, fed with oil from time to time, threw a broad glare upon
the people, and lighted up not only the temple and its quaint and
fanciful ornaments, but the buildings around,&mdash;and above, the crags
and precipices, with the houses hanging to them.</p>

<p>There was not a spot unoccupied; even the ledges and projections
of the high pyramidal roof and spires of the temple were crowded,
while the terraces of the vestibule and cloisters around, reserved for
the ladies of the Hindu gentry of the neighbourhood, and of the
chief visitors and priests, glowed with the gay colours of their
garments, which stood out against the dark background of the
mountain-side.</p>

<p>As the party advanced through the crowd, Moro Trimmul, who
was among the Brahmun reciters, saw the tall figure of Maloosray
behind that of Jeswunt Rao of Sindphul, who was struggling manfully
with the crowd, and advanced hastily to greet him. He had
hardly expected so prompt a compliance with his request, but was
rejoiced that it had been made. He greeted Maloosray and Palkur
heartily, and led them to the reserved space, where, recognized by
many present, and speedily made known to others, they received a
hearty welcome, and took their seats.</p>

<p>A few words whispered, sufficed to explain to Moro Trimmul the
situation of affairs at Beejapoor, and the necessity for immediate
action.</p>

<p>"We must dismiss the assembly earlier than usual," he said, in
reply to Maloosray's anxious question as to how long the ceremonies
would be continued, "and I will hasten what remains. Do not heed
me; I have to take my part now, and as the assembly rises I will
rejoin you."</p>

<p>Thus saying, Moro Trimmul passed into the dark vestibule of the
temple, and was divesting himself of his upper garments and turban,
when, from a pillar behind, the girl Gunga came towards him.</p>

<p>"I have been searching for thee," she said; "they wanted thee.
Where hast thou been so long?"</p>

<p>"No matter where," he said gloomily. "Thou couldst have
found me without, if needful. What hast thou done?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," she replied. "I cannot get speech of her, and the rest
will not join me; they are afraid."</p>

<p>"So art thou, Gunga," he replied; "afraid, afraid of a girl? Ah,
coward and liar!"</p>

<p>"Thou art afraid thyself, Moro Trimmul," she retorted. "Go!
take her away. There she stands, no one will prevent thee; there,
by the door&mdash;alone."</p>

<p>Moro Trimmul stepped from behind the pillar, still keeping within
the gloom, and looked forward. Before the blaze of the shrine, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
the lamps without it, stood Tara, in the act of bearing garlands of
flowers to the altar. A number of them were hanging upon her left
arm, while, with her right hand extended, she was delivering some
to the priest.</p>

<p>As she stood at the door, in the full glare of the lamps within, the
light fell upon her rich crimson silk drapery, its heavy borders and
ends of flowered gold, and the massive gold zone which confined it
round her waist; while the attitude she had involuntarily assumed,
as she turned towards the shrine, showed the graceful outlines of her
figure to peculiar advantage. She had wreathed a long garland of
white flowers into her hair, which fell about her neck and bosom;
and another was twisted round her brows, so as to form a coronet.
It was a fanciful but simple and beautiful decoration, which suited
the character of her small graceful head, and added to the charm of
her attire.</p>

<p>Moro Trimmul watched her intently as she delivered the garlands
to the old priest; then, as if a service had been done, she advanced
to the centre of the doorway, and, making a low reverence, stepped
aside and stood erect, looking into the vestibule in expectation, as it
were, of further devotees. Moro Trimmul could see the sweet mouth
parted in a smile, the pearly teeth glistening within the rosy lips,
and the soft eyes flashing as the strong side light fell upon them.
Beyond her the deep gloom of the recesses of the temple could not
be penetrated. So her figure stood out against it in a power of
effective relief which was almost startling.</p>

<p>It was a strange contrast. Within, the dreaded image, richly
attired and covered with priceless jewels, the tiara on its head, and
the weird ruby eyes, now sparkling brightly, now changing and
glowing fitfully amidst the clouds of incense which was burning
before it, and the black, stony, changeless features, seeming even to
vary in expression with the passing effects of light and shadow.
Without, Tara in her rich attire and glowing beauty, and that rapt
expression in her countenance, which the excitement of the scene and
the service of the "Holy Mother" had caused it to assume.</p>

<p>Moro Trimmul sighed. With all the fierce desire which burned
within him, and which now gave him no rest night or day, there was
mingled, curiously perhaps, a loving reverence for the girl, which,
as yet, had restrained him both from violence and insult. It might
be her character and position which had excited it, but rather,
perhaps, her own innate purity and modesty of mind, and the
charming simplicity of character, which he saw in daily exercise in
her house, that controlled the fiery passions of his nature and his
avowed unscrupulousness.</p>

<p>"If I were a man," sneered his companion, as she stood with him
concealed behind the large pillar, "I should not be a coward when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
such a woman as that was burning at my heart. By the gods, she
is no woman, but an incarnation of beauty. Look at her now!"</p>

<p>"Peace, devil," cried the Brahmun in a hoarse whisper; "hast
thou forgotten the gold, and thy promise by the Pâp-nâs?"</p>

<p>"No, I have not forgotten," said Gunga, "I have part of it here;"
and she shook her foot, on which the gold anklets tinkled slightly;
"and I want to change this silver thing round my waist for a zone
like hers yonder. Ah, how it glows among the rich silk! But thou
art a coward, Moro Trimmul, else I had earned it long ago; and I
could have helped thee."</p>

<p>"Go and speak to her, Gunga, and I will believe thee braver than
I am," he replied tauntingly. "If she cannot be spoken with, how
wilt thou earn the zone?"</p>

<p>The girl regarded him with a look of defiance, and, without reply,
stepped forward into the light, advanced towards the shrine, making
a slight reverence to the image, glided forwards, and stood opposite
to Tara.</p>

<p>"Thou hast served many hours, sister," she said, in an assumed
voice of kindness, "and must be weary; sit down within for a while,
and I will do what is needed; 'tis my office," she continued, laughing,
"as well as thine."</p>

<p>Moro Trimmul marked the involuntary shudder of aversion which
spread over Tara's countenance, and the action of withdrawing the
skirts of her garment between her ankles, which accompanied it.
Then she spoke.</p>

<p>"I am not weary of the Mother's service; when I am I will come
no more," she said gently. "Go away; I will not speak with thee
or thy people, and that thou knowest full well; go."</p>

<p>"And why should I go?" cried Gunga, excitedly; "am I not a
Moorlee like thyself, and have I not served the Mother longer than
thee? To be sure, I am neither a Brahmun nor a widow to be nice
as thou art; yet I bid thee go, and let me have my turn: thou hast
had more than thy share of money already to-day."</p>

<p>"It is all in the shrine before the Mother," said Tara, shrinking
from the bold glances and excited manner of the girl. "I have
taken none of it: I need it not."</p>

<p>"That does not matter," said Gunga; "I will have my turn now.
Go away; thou art not wanted. Those that will not dance before
the Mother are not worthy to serve her. Go, else some of us will
push thee out."</p>

<p>"Me!" cried Tara, drawing up her slight figure proudly, her eyes
flashing, and her features quivering with indignation,&mdash;"me! you
dare not; you are impure, and the Mother loathes you: touch me,
and she will strike you dead!"</p>

<p>Gunga shrunk from the trial; and others of her sisterhood, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
had stood apart ready to advance, slunk again into the gloom behind
the pillars. Gunga looked round as if for countenance, but no one
seemed disposed to join her, while the old priest at the altar, who
had caught the sound of voices, came to the door, and, seeing Gunga,
waved her off.</p>

<p>"Away with ye, and the like of ye!" he cried. "Outside do as
ye please; here ye are an offence. Away! let her stay;" and he
pointed to Tara. "Do not molest her."</p>

<p>"There is some spell about thee, Tara, which shuts my mouth;
beware!" muttered Gunga, retreating; "it may not always be so."</p>

<p>"Bear me witness," said Tara to the old priest, "she is threatening
me."</p>

<p>"Ah, daughter," he replied, smiling, "fear not such as she; the
Mother is good to thee; and they cannot harm thee so long as thou
art holy and pure."</p>

<p>"I did not tell thee to quarrel with her," said Moro Trimmul
angrily, seizing Gunga's arm as she approached, and dragging her
within the shadow of the pillar. "Art thou mad, or has any one
given thee drink, Gunga?"</p>

<p>"I spoke to her kindly, which is more than thou darest to do,"
retorted the girl sharply. "What answer did I get? Pure? Why
should she be pure? I tell thee there is a spell about her neck&mdash;I
saw it glittering among the flowers&mdash;which put me back: I could
not speak. Yes, Moro Trimmul, if it be only to put that spell under
my foot, and crush it with her throat, I will do it; yes, I will earn
the gold; let her see to herself."</p>

<p>"Good," he replied; "then I can trust thee. Come to me to-morrow,
and fail not." And then, naked to the waist, with his soft
glossy hair falling over his shoulders, and his fine figure displayed to
the best advantage, Moro Trimmul passed out, and took his place
among the reciters.</p>

<p>Gunga's eyes followed him. "Drink!" she muttered; "drink!
he said that. Well, better drink than this madness, which is worse."
And, sitting down, leaning against a pillar, she hid her face in her
garment, and sobbed bitterly.</p>

<p>Just then, one of the ordinary processions round the temple formed
opposite the shrine. Priests, bearing offerings of flowers and lighted
lamps, holy water and incense, preceded by musicians, and chanting
a hymn, passed out into the court. Several of the temple girls
were dancing before it; and Tara, led on by an excitement she could
not control, had seized a pair of cymbals, and began to clash them
in the cadence of the hymn as the procession moved.</p>

<p>Three times round and round did the priests pass, and at the
second Gunga joined it, dancing wildly and tossing her arms on
high as she circled with the rest. Tara, however, remained among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
the priests, singing with them; yet, in the elastic grace of her step,
as well as in the expression of her face, it was evident that she
shared the fervour of the scene, and could not control herself, while
her clear ringing voice mingled sweetly with the deeper-toned chant
of the men.</p>

<p>Maloosray saw Tara, and watched the eyes of Moro Trimmul
wandering from one girl to the other with an intense expression of
passion. "Ah, my poor friend!" he said to himself, "that is the
devil sitting at thy heart, and looking out of thine eyes! Alas!
alas! who is she&mdash;that girl?" he asked of Jeswunt Rao, who sat
by him.</p>

<p>"She is our new Moorlee," replied the man; "is she not beautiful?&mdash;But
listen to Moro Trimmul."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XLVIII" id="CHAPTER_XLVIII">CHAPTER XLVIII.</a></h2>


<p>Never had the Brahmun's art been so effectively exercised by him
before. In the recitation of passages from the Ramayun his voice,
high and sonorous, pervading every portion of the court, delivered
the appeals to war, the description of the demigod's forces, and
portions of the battles, with a power which was listened to with
breathless interest; while the pleadings of Seeta, the beloved wife,
and her passionate confessions of love, were accompanied by tender
actions, and tones as low and sweet as a woman's. Now rolled forth
the majestic Sanscrit verse in its measured numbers, and again it
was changed to the sweet Mahratta vernacular, that all could understand.
At every interval the applause of the whole assembly arose
in hoarse murmurs and loud clapping of hands, while many wept
passionately.</p>

<p>No one would have moved till morning, but there was yet much
to do; and, as Moro Trimmul sat down, Vyas Shastree ordered the
distribution of wreaths of flowers to the chief guests, which announced
the close of recitation for the night. Now, therefore, the
main body of the people got up and began to separate, and in a
short time only those were left who had been specially requested to
stay. Now, too, the cressets, no longer fed with oil, went out one
by one; and the deep gloom of night was fast spreading over the
courts and buildings around.</p>

<p>"Will you not remain, Shastree," said Moro Trimmul, "to speak
with these people?"</p>

<p>"No," he said; "no; there is no one to go home with the women.
I thought you would accompany them."</p>

<p>"It will be late," he replied, gloomily; "no, I cannot come to-night."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>"Your declamation was noble, Moro Trimmul," said the Shastree;
"I had never heard the passages so spoken. Who taught you this
style?"</p>

<p>"That is the way our master likes them said. No one taught me,"
he replied; "and if you could hear the whole in one of his assemblies
in the deep forest, you would feel that you were a Mahratta."</p>

<p>"So I am&mdash;so I am," returned the Shastree quickly; "do you
doubt it?"</p>

<p>"Not your faith, Vyas Shastree," replied Moro Trimmul, "only
your energy. But go; I will come early to-morrow;" and, turning
away, he entered the vestibule and joined Maloosray and others who
awaited him. Guards of men, he saw, had been placed at each of
the porches, so that no one could enter but those privileged.</p>

<p>A solitary lamp flickered on the altar where the image still rested,
and cast a feeble and uncertain light into that portion of the vestibule
which was immediately before it, and where Maloosray, Moro
Trimmul, and the rest now seated themselves. Otherwise the
spacious area was altogether in deep gloom, a portion only of its
massive stone pillars catching rays of light, and seeming like giants
standing around in solemn array.</p>

<p>We need hardly, perhaps, follow Maloosray in his narrative, which
was listened to with breathless interest by his hearers. He had
never as yet come among them, but his name and feats were well
known through many a rough ballad both of love and war. There he
sat, face to face with them; his large soft eyes flashing with excitement,
and adding force to the few but burning words he spoke.
Tannajee was no novice in the art of reading men's hearts; and
among the mountains and valleys where he lived, there were already
thousands of the best youth of the country at his command.</p>

<p>"Now," he said finally, "ye have heard all. We are before the
Holy Mother, who comes to our Prince in his dreams, and tells him
what to do; she who will scatter these impure cow-slaying Moslems
like sheep before the wolf. O Holy Mother!" he continued, rising
and bowing with joined hands in adoration to the image, "here are
thy children; bless them, make them bold and true; they will swear
not to hang back when 'the fire is on the hills,' and when they can
strike for thy honour. Hear thou the oath, and accept it."</p>

<p>As he paused and looked round there was at first a low murmur
of acquiescence. Then they who had been sitting started to their
feet, and as many as could reach it rushed to the threshold of the
sanctum and touched it reverently:&mdash;those who could not, stretched
out their arms towards it over each other's heads, while wild cries
of "Jey Kalee!" "Jey Toolja Máta!" "Bome, Bome!" (We swear,
we swear!) rang through the vestibule, and were taken up by those
without.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now, let us write the names," cried Maloosray, when the excitement
had in some degree subsided; "sit down again, friends, and
if there be a scribe among ye let him come forward."</p>

<p>The Putwari, or hereditary clerk of the temple, was there, with
his writing materials tied up in a bundle, and he sat down and took
them out.</p>

<p>"Light one of the large lamps," said Moro Trimmul to an inferior
priest, "and set it in the midst; we are not afraid of our faces before
the Mother."</p>

<p>As the wicks were lighted, one by one, the assembly seemed to
dilate. Light after light flickered, but grew stronger. "A true
omen," cried Maloosray, with fervour; "that is as we shall be, my
friends. Light after light will appear to ye from afar; each may
waver for a while, but when 'the fire is on the hills' ye will see all
plainly. Be silent now, and let us write."</p>

<p>It was, indeed, a strange and impressive scene. In the midst sat
Maloosray and Moro Trimmul, with the scribe; around, the heads
of local families, Nimbalkurs, Bhóslays, Sindias, Ghoreparays, and
a host of others, each anxious to be named in the record, and leaning
forward to catch the eye of the scribe. Beyond them&mdash;some
kneeling, others standing&mdash;was a crowd of eager faces, all bearing
the same expression of excitement&mdash;one behind another on every
side&mdash;while the light fell upon their bronzed features and glistening
eyes, till those in the background were scarcely distinguishable.</p>

<p>One by one&mdash;chiefs, gentry, yeomen&mdash;gave in their names and
complements of men, and page after page was filled by the record
till no more remained.</p>

<p>"It is done, friends," said Maloosray, rising, as the Putwari had
added up the totals, and signed his name as the scribe; "there are
more than fifteen thousand men recorded. Enough for the time,
and more hereafter. By-and-by, when 'the fire is on the hills,' ye
will be welcome; till then, separate and be quiet, else Afzool Khan
will come upon you, and we can give you no help. We will abide
the storm and let it pass over us, and so must you all."</p>

<p>As he spoke the last words, those who had been sitting rose, and
all in turn saluting Maloosray, the meeting broke up. The retainers
of the respective leaders gathered round their masters, and the
several parties followed each other out of the temple precincts.</p>

<p>"I shall depart before daylight, Moro Trimmul," said Maloosray,
as they proceeded to the postern which led to the bottom of the
ravine, below which their ponies and attendants awaited their
coming; "wilt thou follow?"</p>

<p>"I have more to do here, Tannajee," he replied; "but after the
Now Râtree I will come. I must watch Afzool Khan and Pahar
Singh."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<p>"Take care they do not watch thee," returned Maloosray. "Yet
I fear not for thy enemies; of them thou art careful. I fear for
thee, because of that girl who played the cymbals. She is the devil
that I see sitting at thy heart, and looking out of thine eyes. I
watched thee as they followed her. It were well for thee to come
now, even now; come!"</p>

<p>"Impossible," returned the Brahmun, turning away. "Go!"</p>

<p>"As thou wilt, friend," returned Maloosray. "Words were
always useless with thee; but be wary."</p>

<p>Moro Trimmul watched the party as they descended the steps to
the tamarind trees below. He saw them mount and ride off, the
torches with them throwing a ruddy glare upon the crags and
brushwood above the path,&mdash;and his heart bade him follow; but as
one of the temple watchers was about to close and bar the door, he
turned aside. All in the building was dark and deserted now. The
image had been taken from the altar, and put into its silken bed for
the night, and a faint lamp occupied its place. A few attendants
flitted hastily here and there across the dark courts and still darker
vestibule, anxious to get away, and the watchers only were all that
would soon remain.</p>

<p>"Maharaj!&mdash;Moro!" said a female voice in a low whisper, as he
passed between the pillars of the temple, "stop!"</p>

<p>Moro Trimmul knew the voice. "Why art thou so late here,
Gunga?" he said hastily. "Begone!"</p>

<p>"I feared you were angry with me," said the girl, putting her
hand on his arm. "You would not look at me as I danced, only at
her. I could not go till I had spoken with you. Ah, you are not
angry with me? Lo! I will do your bidding, though my heart break
and I die. Sit here, beloved, and speak to me; come," and she tried
to draw him to her gently.</p>

<p>"Thou art one of the devils that are pulling me into hell!" cried
the Brahmun fiercely; and, pushing her violently from him, he
rushed wildly across the court.</p>

<p>Gunga fell back heavily against the pillar nearest to her, and as
she recovered herself, the pain of the fall obliged her to sit down,
involuntarily leaning against it. She drew her hand with a gesture
of weariness across her face and brow, then looked to see if there
were blood upon it. "Hath it come to this?" she said bitterly;
"hath it come to this&mdash;and for her? Ah, me for her!"</p>

<p>The girl had listened unobserved, in a dark niche near the shrine,
to what had transpired at the meeting, and her first thought now
was revenge, sure and deadly. A word from her, and the Mahomedan
officer in charge of the town would seize Moro Trimmul,
and imprison him in Nuldroog. As the thought occurred to her
she rose, and, hastily traversing the court, began to mount the steps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
which led up the ravine; but her heart failed, and ere she had
ascended a few of them she wavered, sat down, and wept bitterly.</p>

<p>"They would kill him," she said, "and he must not die. No; I
was wrong, and he will forgive me; and to-morrow I will go to him
as he desired." Hers was a callous heart: but it had softened to
her lover, and refused to do him harm.</p>

<p>Time or country, what matter? How often is the history of
woman's love and man's passion like this! how often does such
erring love frame excuse for bitter wrong, endured from him who,&mdash;of
all the world,&mdash;should least inflict it!</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XLIX" id="CHAPTER_XLIX">CHAPTER XLIX.</a></h2>


<p>A few days had elapsed, and it was a quiet afternoon in the Shastree's
dwelling. The household work had long been done; the
visit to the temple and the noonday worship were over. Vyas
Shastree had remained there in discussion with other Brahmuns;
Radha, complaining of a headache, had fallen asleep; Tara had
read all that her father had appointed her to study during the day,
and was waiting his return to have certain passages explained to
her before she proceeded with her task.</p>

<p>The house was perfectly still, and from the town no sound reached
them, for the heat without was great, and until evening there would
be comparatively few persons astir. It was calm, and large white
clouds were sailing slowly over an intensely blue sky, gathering into
masses pile upon pile, of dazzling brightness, as the sun's rays fell
upon them. The heat and peculiar state of the atmosphere caused
the outlines of buildings and of the mountains to waver; and
wherever the eye rested on any object, the air between seemed to
quiver with a tremulous motion.</p>

<p>Hot as it was, Tara had not been deterred from her self-imposed
duty. Throwing a heavy folded sheet over her shoulders and head,
she had accompanied her father to the noonday service; nor, since
the occasion when she took upon herself the office of the priesthood,
and devoted herself to the duties of the shrine, had she on any
pretence missed or evaded the necessary attendance.</p>

<p>At first, perhaps, it was a severe trial. The licence, accorded by
general custom to the attendant priestesses, was to her abhorrent;
and, on the other hand, Tara's unapproachable purity had given
offence to them. While Gunga, therefore, and two or three others,
proposed the prohibition of Tara's service, the rest, fearing the
consequences, and having a real respect and love for the girl whom
they had watched from her childhood, refused to interfere with her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
Tara did them no harm, they said, and her father could punish all,
were any annoyance given to his daughter.</p>

<p>It is probable that matters might have continued in this state for
some time longer, but for the scene we have already recorded, and
the increasing jealousy of Gunga, expression of which could hardly
be repressed by her; and on the day we now write of, the girl's
behaviour had been studiously offensive to Tara until rebuked by
the attendant Brahmuns, when she retired sulkily.</p>

<p>More insulting than that, however, was Moro Trimmul's manner
to herself; and for the first time Tara had felt what she long
dreaded,&mdash;the shame, as it were, of her vocation&mdash;the unavoidable
exposure to any libertine glance which might fall on her; but she
had rallied herself at the shrine, and, secure in the protection of
the "Mother" she adored, had persevered in her duty without
interruption.</p>

<p>There was, as we have said, perfect stillness in the house, only
broken by the dull monotonous whirr of the spinning-wheels, as her
own and her mother's flew swiftly round, with which the buzz of
flies in the verandah and court seemed to harmonize. Her mother
appeared particularly intent upon spinning some remarkably fine
yarn; and as the thread had broken on several occasions, when
Tara had spoken to her, and she had complained of it, both had
fallen into a silence, which had not been interrupted. Gradually,
then, the small troubles which had gathered about Tara returned to
her recollection; and, as is generally the case on such occasions,
began, in spite of herself, to increase in proportions.</p>

<p>Tara's was not, however, a suspicious nature, and she had soon
struck out a course for herself in regard to the sisterhood. "It is
the money they want, not me: if I save it all, and give it to
the Putwari to divide amongst them daily, it will surely be enough,"
she thought; and this she determined to do. In regard, however,
to Moro Trimmul, it was very different. "Why did he look at her
as he had done that day?"</p>

<p>Then her thoughts reverted to the time when she had first remarked
him in the temple, a solitary stranger worshipper, to whom
her father had spoken kindly. Her memory followed clearly his
gradual steps to intimacy; but there was nothing she could charge
him with, as an approach to familiarity in their intercourse. Through
all the licence of the marriage time&mdash;through all her visits to his
aunt and sister&mdash;there had been no violation of propriety; on the
contrary, an habitual and respectful avoidance of her&mdash;or, at most,
a distant and courteous salutation. Why should it have altered?</p>

<p>But since the night on which Gunga had spoken to her, and
Moro Trimmul had made his famous declamation of the scene
in the Ramayun, there had been a change. He either avoided her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
altogether, or his eyes dropped furtively as she passed, or met hers,
as they had done that day, in a glance new to her, and inexpressibly
offensive. Tara shuddered as she remembered it, and the action
broke the thread she was spinning. She did not resume her work,
and her hands fell listlessly on her lap as her foot ceased its motion.
For a time her eyes wandered vacantly among her flowers, about
which some gay butterflies were flitting and chasing each other
in the bright sunlight; but suddenly a large dragonfly, which had
been hovering over them, darted at one and carried it off; and as
she started forward, gazing intently after it, a bird chased the insect,
caught it, and flew away.</p>

<p>Perhaps the sudden cessation of the whirr of Tara's wheel had
attracted her mother's attention; for after a while, as it was not
resumed, she looked up. "What dost thou see?" she asked,
anxiously; for ever since the day on which Tara said the goddess
appeared to her, Anunda had been anxious, she hardly knew why:
but she dreaded a return of that strange and violent excitement.
"What dost thou see, beloved?"</p>

<p>Tara did not apparently hear the question, or did not notice it.
Her hands, which had been involuntarily extended, fell upon her
lap listlessly as before; but she turned towards her mother. "How
long does he remain, mother?" she asked abruptly.</p>

<p>"He! who, daughter?" returned Anunda.</p>

<p>"Radha's brother," replied the girl, as a shiver seemed to pass
through her; "Radha said he would go after the marriage, yet he
delays. Why, mother&mdash;why does he not go?"</p>

<p>"Nay, and how should I know?" replied Anunda. "What is he
to me? All I wanted was Radha, and we have got her; and he
may go or come as he pleases. Thy father told me he had business
here with the Nimbalkur and others till the Now Râtree was over,
and he assists in the recitations. More I know not. Why dost
thou ask? What is he to thee, Tara?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, mother; but so long?&mdash;will he stay so long?"</p>

<p>"Radha told me yesterday he must soon rejoin his people in the
west, and leave her; and she was crying about it. Does that content
thee, Tara?"</p>

<p>"I would he were gone, mother," said Tara, rising from her low
stool, kneeling, and throwing her arms about Anunda as she sat on
a similar one, while she hid her face in her dress. "Cannot he go
sooner?&mdash;cannot Radha send him away?"</p>

<p>"Why, daughter? why?&mdash;Ah! he hath not spoken to thee, child;
he dare not! Tell me," she continued, in a more agitated tone, as
her daughter clung almost convulsively to her, "what is this?
Why dost thou fear him? Thou&mdash;thou dost not? ... thou canst
not&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, no, mother," cried the girl quickly, guessing her mother's
thoughts, and looking up innocently; "fear not. I am not a
Moorlee to love; ... fear not! But ah, mother, I dread him!
I will not go to the temple while he is there. I ... I dare not&mdash;I
dare not go. May the Holy Mother forgive me for neglect; but
when he departs, I will serve her night and day."</p>

<p>"Thou art very beautiful, my child," said her mother, smoothing
back the glossy hair and stroking the soft cheek which lay passively
in her lap. "Ah, thou art very beautiful; and I fear such as he!
Yes, if it be as thou sayest, it were better, indeed, to live secluded
for a while. I will tell thy father, and he will understand it."</p>

<p>"Yes, he will surely understand," said Tara absently; "but ah,
mother, was not that an omen? I thought it was, and I came to
thee."</p>

<p>"What omen, Tara? I saw nothing, child."</p>

<p>"A thought came into my mind, mother," she said sadly, "that I
was the butterfly sporting among the flowers, and he the fierce
glistening insect that darted upon it and bore it away. But then,
mother, the bird came and took both. Why was that?"</p>

<p>"Thou art not well, Tara," replied her mother, not understanding
her, for she had not noticed the occurrence, and, seeing her shiver,
thought her feverish. "Thou art not well; lie in my arms for a
while, and the cold will pass away. O Holy Mother!" she cried
aloud, as Tara, sobbing convulsively, hid her face in her bosom,
"let not evil come to this child&mdash;thine and mine. O, be good to
her, as thou hast taken her!"</p>

<p>"Would that it were so," said the girl, after a while, and still
sobbing. "I would go, mother, if she would take me. What use
am I in life? It would be bitter to leave the house and all of ye,
but I should be with her. Did she not promise this when she
touched my hair? Ah, yes; and she will not forget it."</p>

<p>"Hush, child; let this fancy pass from thee. Sleep, now, here.
I will sing thee the old song. Nay, thou shalt not leave me! There
is room at thy mother's heart, and strength still in her arms, to hold
thee safely."</p>

<p>As Tara laid herself softly down in the old place, and her mother,
rocking herself to and fro, sang the low sweet lullaby of childhood,&mdash;the
girl's sobbing gradually stopped, and a gentle sleep fell upon
her. Anunda watched the change anxiously. At first her brow
was contracted, as if with pain, and a broken sob came now and
again with her breathing; but gradually the head fell back on her
arm, the sweet mouth opened slightly, and tears, which had had no
vent before, welled gently from under the closed eyelids as the
features relaxed into a smile.</p>

<p>"Yes," thought Anunda, as she bent over her child, while her own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
tears fell hot and fast, "the Mother is with her now, and she is
again happy."</p>

<p>"What hath happened?" asked Radha soon afterwards, as, refreshed
by her sleep, she rose, and came gently towards the low
spinning-chair on which Anunda still sat. "Is she ill?"</p>

<p>"Hush!" returned Anunda, in a whisper. "If we can lay her
down I will tell thee, but we must not wake her. I think.... I
think the Mother hath been with her again; but I will tell thee."</p>

<p>Radha hastily spread out a soft mattress and pillow close to the
stool, and, raising Tara together, they laid her down upon it, as they
would a child. Her mother patted her gently as she lay, and
gradually the same sweet smile as at first again stole over her face.</p>

<p>"Look, she sees the Mother!" said Anunda reverently. "It is
always so, and nothing can wake her till the time is past. Ah, thou
art happy now, my child, be it ever so with thee!"</p>

<p>"What did she say, sister?" asked Radha, as, having thrown a
light sheet over the sleeping girl, they sat down to watch her apart,
lest the noise of the wheels&mdash;for Radha had taken Tara's and joined
the broken thread&mdash;should awaken her. "What did the goddess
say?"</p>

<p>Anunda hesitated. As yet no difference had arisen between them,
and Radha still looked up to her, more with the respect of a child
for its mother than as a sister-wife would comport herself to her
equal. Should she tell Radha all? It had occurred to her that he
had imposed upon her some task which she hesitated to perform&mdash;that
Radha had some impatience of her brother's presence. It might
be a demand for money&mdash;it might be in relation to the political
objects of his mission, of which Anunda had a deep dread, lest her
husband should become an active party, and so be embroiled with
the Mahomedan officers of the country. She considered for a moment:
but Anunda's was no timid nature. She was not afraid of Radha;
and with Tara's happiness at stake, she could risk no ceremony with
the sister of him who had evidently caused more than a passing
cloud.</p>

<p>"Radha," she said gently, "thou art more than a sister-wife to
me. Nay, as a daughter I have trusted to thee the happiness which
lay nearest my heart and hers; and I believe thee faithful to it,
and that this home and all in it is growing precious to thee."</p>

<p>"To me? Ah, yes, O sister and mother, too! Radha is new to
you all," she replied, "but will be true now, very true, and will not
fail! O mother, if you could know what it is to me to have a
loving home!"</p>

<p>"Then Tara must not be injured&mdash;no evil must come to her,"
said Anunda, interrupting her.</p>

<p>"To Tara, mother? We are sisters, who will do her evil?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>

<p>"I fear thy brother, Radha&mdash;not thee. Hath he said aught to
thee?" returned Anunda.</p>

<p>"My brother! O, heed him not, he will soon go," returned Radha,
her features expressing distress and agitation, and she already
feared the worst.</p>

<p>"Ah, then, it is as I expected&mdash;as she dreaded. Radha, this must
not be. Hast thou any power over him?"</p>

<p>"None," said the girl, bursting into tears, for what she had most
apprehended appeared to have reached her at last&mdash;"none. He has
been wilful always&mdash;to me, to our father when he lived, and to all.
Where he goes&mdash;who are his companions&mdash;what he does&mdash;no one knows
except our Prince whom he serves, and Tannajee&mdash;who came so suddenly
that night&mdash;whom I showed to you. No, mother, I have no
power and no influence. What does he care about me?"</p>

<p>"He must care," said the matron stoutly, "or he must care for
me; and yet, for thy sake, I would not provoke him. But, O Radha!
when thou hast had a child lying at thy heart&mdash;drinking its life from
thy breast&mdash;climbing about thee&mdash;thou wilt understand what a woman
can dare for it&mdash;what I could dare for Tara! Wilt thou speak to
him, or shall I?"</p>

<p>Radha feared her brother. She did not know the extent to which
his unscrupulous and profligate mind might carry him, but she had
not forgotten his threats. Though she felt assured that, with the
protection her husband could afford her, she was now beyond all
ordinary harm at his hands, she feared the consequences both to herself
and Tara with which he had before threatened her, and she
dreaded his violence. Could he have been mad enough to speak to
Tara? Could he have sent any insulting message to her? Something
must have occurred, and she felt too sick at heart to ask.</p>

<p>"Thou art silent, Radha," continued Anunda; "why?"</p>

<p>"I love Tara; I love him too," she said earnestly, the tears starting
to her eyes. "Yes, I will speak to him, even though he should
strike me. Mother, I can bear it from him. Can you send me to
him?&mdash;now, now!&mdash;or send for him? If I am to go, let it be at
once, for this is a matter in which I cannot hesitate. O dear mother!"
she continued, rising and advancing, "I am a child yet to thee.
Let me put my head on thy breast for once, and bless me there as
thou wouldst Tara: bless me ere I go to him. No, not so, not so;
but as Tara lay on thy breast, so would I too, for once."</p>

<p>"Come, Radha!" cried Anunda. "O child! O sister-wife! come;
henceforth between thee and me there is no veil. I had longed to
draw it away, but thou hast done it now, and I am happy. Yes,
henceforth ye are to me as one," she continued, smoothing the soft
cheek as it lay at her heart&mdash;"new and old, but alike."</p>

<p>"Enough; now I am content," cried the girl, rising and clapping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
her hands, "and there shall be no fear for Tara. Send some one
with me and let me go; he should not come here."</p>

<p>"No, Radha," said Anunda, calling a trusty woman-servant to
accompany her, "not here. Go to him, and return soon."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_L" id="CHAPTER_L">CHAPTER L.</a></h2>


<p>"Is my brother within? has he returned from the temple?" asked
Radha of a man sitting in the porch of the house in which Moro
Trimmul resided, and, though in another street, was only a few
steps distant. "Is he come, Chimna?"</p>

<p>"Yes, lady, he is come," returned the man, who was an old retainer
of the family, and had known her from infancy; "but if you
take my advice, you will not go to him now: he has eaten nothing,
and is in one of his rough angry moods. I did but speak to him as
he entered, and got as many curses as will serve me for a month.
Why not come another time?"</p>

<p>"Nay, Chimna, but it is an urgent matter, and I must now have
speech of him," she replied. "Go, say I am come, and that he must
admit me. Begone at once," she continued, seeing him hesitate,
"else it will be worse for you."</p>

<p>"I had rather you went yourself," returned the man, "what if he
should beat me? But no matter, I will go; perhaps I may not do
you much more service, for he speaks of departing."</p>

<p>"Ah, indeed! When?" exclaimed Radha. "He is not ill?"</p>

<p>"Soon, perhaps," replied the man, putting his finger to the side
of his nose, as a caution to secrecy, while he stepped across the
court to the verandah, "very soon, I think. No, he is not ill, only
vexed with something."</p>

<p>Radha's heart beat fast in her bosom. O, if it were but true;
and that her brother, alarmed or repentant, no matter which, were
about to depart, it would solve all difficulties at once. That very
day&mdash;to-morrow! It seemed hard to wish him gone; yet there
would be peace to Tara and to her mother, which was endangered
by his presence. Surely he would see her. Yes; Chimna was now
descending the steps of the house, and beckoned to her with a
smiling face. She crossed the court at once, followed by the servant.</p>

<p>"He is in the upper room," he said, "and bid thee come alone:
perhaps he is not well, for he is lying down, and seems weary. No
wonder he was in ill-humour with me, after that long disputation
with the Nassuk Brahmun to-day in the temple,&mdash;some relation of
the Shastree's, I believe, lady."</p>

<p>"Enough, Chimna; take care of my servant till I return," said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
Radha. "You can sit here; if I want you I will call;" and so
saying she passed through a door into the inner court, and up the
steps which led to the apartments above, which were steep and
narrow. The door was closed at the top of them, and she knocked
before she opened it. Her brother unfastened it inside. "Enter,"
he said quickly; "it is well thou art come, I was thinking how I
could see thee, Radha. Sit down there," and he hastily arranged
a few pillows and a travelling mattress for her, "and speak to me;"
and at the same time threw himself heavily upon a low bed which
was close to the seat he had contrived.</p>

<p>"O, I am weary, Radha," he continued, "very weary. I have no
sleep, no rest; I cannot eat, and there is a burning thirst ever with
me. I shall die if this lasts long."</p>

<p>"Brother, you are ill," she replied; "this place does not agree
with you? Why not go away for a time and change the air?
Chimna says you have eaten nothing; why is this? With all there
is to do for the master, this is no time to be ill. Is there nothing
better for him than lingering here? Surely Tannajee brought news
of him?"</p>

<p>"Ay, sister, and there is more," and he pointed to a heap of
letters on the floor; "enough to make one tremble for the result of
years of toil and strife with the men of Islam. Listen: Maloosray
brought word of their preparations at Beejapoor, and they write
that to-day or to-morrow Afzool Khan and his son Fazil, with all
the forces at Nuldroog and Sholapoor, and many others, will begin
a march upon Wye and Purtâbgurh. What can we do?"</p>

<p>"Is this Moro Trimmul, my brother, who is speaking?" said the
girl, with some scorn in her tone, and drawing herself up. "I
thought he, like Tannajee and the master, could see no hindrance
to the cause of the Holy Mother but death. He used to say so in&mdash;in&mdash;the
old times," she added tenderly.</p>

<p>"The old times?" he echoed. "Yes, the old times, when thou
hadst a royal lover, girl; not a drivelling book-worm!"</p>

<p>"Hush, Moro," returned Radha sharply; "no more of that.
Thou hast buried it in the marriage, and he is kind to me. Why
remember it?"</p>

<p>"Is it to be forgotten? Dost thou forget it, Radha?&mdash;then,
when we brought thee back from him?"</p>

<p>"He never loved me," she returned; "he could not love a mad
child; he told me so when he gently put me away."</p>

<p>"Not for the mad child, but for the beautiful girl, would he care;
he does care, Radha. O sister, why was this hateful marriage done,
so far away from us?"</p>

<p>"Nay, brother, thou knowest best; but I am content&mdash;he is very
kind to me; and they all love Radha now, even Anunda."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>

<p>"Radha," said her brother, raising himself on his arms and
looking at her intently, and till his eyes seemed to flash with a light
glowing beneath them. "Radha, do not lie. If thou art my sister,
thy heart is far away among the blue mountains and their deep
forests, and with our Prince. If it be not so, the witchcraft of that
house hath compassed thee with a spell, as it has me."</p>

<p>"Witchcraft, brother? they do no witchcraft," she replied simply.</p>

<p>"By the Mother, they do," he cried; "feel my hands, feel my
head, they are burning, and Tara has set me on fire."</p>

<p>"Moro, thou art ill; this is fever," returned his sister anxiously.
"I was like this yesterday, and Anunda gave me some medicine,
and I slept, and it passed away. Let me fetch some, or send the
woman for it."</p>

<p>"No, no, Radha," he said hoarsely, "this is no fever; this is a
spell on me, and I cannot break it. This is the spell Tara wears
round her neck, Gunga told me of it. It would not let her speak;
it draws me to her, and then puts me away till I burn. O sister, I
burn all over, and at night when there is no one with me&mdash;O, it is
terrible, terrible; and she comes and mocks me, and holds out water
and flowers, and then snatches them away. I tell thee she is a
witch, a devil, and she has set me on fire. Bring her to me and I
will tell her so."</p>

<p>"Brother, dear brother," said the girl, "you are ill, and there is
no one to tend you. I will stay; why did you not send for me?
why not tell me of this sooner? Now, I will not leave you, you
must not be alone."</p>

<p>"Radha, I am not ill," he replied; "I need no tending. Was I
ill yesterday, when I overcame the Brahmuns from Punderpoor in
the discussion at night, and when I could have said the Ramayun
by heart? Was I ill to-day when I strove with the Nassuk
Brahmuns in logic? No, girl, I am not ill in body, only at heart.
And when she comes to the temple, and goes round the shrine
crowned with flowers, clashing the cymbals and singing hymns
with the priests, then I see the charm on her bosom, and it sparkles;
and I hear her ringing voice, and I grow mad, Radha&mdash;mad ...
and this fever comes on me, and I burn as they do in hell&mdash;as I do
now. Look!" he cried in a shrill cry of pain, "look, she is there,
mocking me now, and pushing me in.... O Tara!" he continued
in a plaintive voice, after a pause, stretching out his hands
and shutting his eyes, as he turned away, "do not kill me, do not
burn me; I kiss your feet, I worship you, beloved! do not harm
me!"</p>

<p>"What can I do? what can I do?" cried Radha, wringing her
hands. "He will die. Ho, Chimna!"</p>

<p>"Silence, Radha; for your life call no one. I will strike you if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
you do," he said, raising his arm. "Look, she is gone! she was
there&mdash;there, even now. I turned away, for her eyes burned me;
there was no love in them&mdash;none. She came and mocked me, and
you are witness of it. Why did she come in the air? She is a
spirit&mdash;a witch&mdash;and it is always thus. There&mdash;look&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Radha looked tremblingly where he pointed. It was impossible
not to be infected with the terror and misery of his face and voice.
The room had open arches of wood on one side, across which heavy
curtains were drawn; but they were partially open, and, looking
through them, all she saw was the terraces of the houses of the
town gradually descending into the great ravine: the crags and
precipices of its further side: with the trees, and gilded spires and
pinnacles of the temple between. Beyond these, the rugged mountain
and the plain below, hazy with quivering light, and melting
into the sky.</p>

<p>"You see nothing, sister?" he said. "No, she is gone now."</p>

<p>"No, Moro, there is nothing there but the town and the temple.
O Holy Mother!" continued Radha, stretching out her hands to it,
"save him; save my brother! I vow to thee&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Make no vows for me, Radha," he said to her, sharply catching
her arm; "she is my enemy; I know it. She loves Tara better
than me; she will not give her to me. I asked her for Tara long
ago; see what has come of it. I have done all the secret rites that
her worship enjoins, but she is not content; she mocks me, and
when I look at her eyes they glitter with malice. To-day she
seemed to glower at me from among the smoke, and Tara was there
offering flowers. They both mocked me. Yes, they are devils; but
I fear them no more, Radha. May her house be desolate, and her
shrine desecrated."</p>

<p>"Hush, brother!" cried the girl, putting her hand before his
mouth, to stop what she believed to be horrible and deadly blasphemy.
"Hush! what if she heard you? O Mother, gentle
Mother, forgive him this madness. I vow to thee&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You will make me curse you, Radha," he said, again grasping
her arm violently. "Did I not tell you I would have no vows to
her, liar and murderess as she is? Yes, I see it now. You, too, are
one with them, and are come to mock me; and yet, Radha," he continued,
looking at her tenderly, "was this good of you after all I
have done for you? O, faithless!"</p>

<p>"Moro," returned Radha, weeping sorely, and sobbing so that
she could hardly speak, "I am not faithless. I am true to you,
even to death, my brother."</p>

<p>"Good," he said gravely; but again fixing his eyes upon her, so
that she could hardly bear his intense gaze. "True? Ah, yes, if
all are false, Radha should be true&mdash;true to him and to me. Now,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
listen," he continued, slowly and impressively, "if thou art true, tell
Tara I am in fear of her charm; bid her look kindly on me&mdash;bid her
put it away from her breast. I will kiss her feet; I will daily
measure with my body every step she takes round the shrine, so
that she give me one kind look,&mdash;so that I see that love in her eyes
which is burning in me day and night&mdash;day and night.</p>

<p>"But that is not all," he resumed, after a pause. "Am I mad?
Dost thou think me so for this raving? By the gods, no! Only
for her. Let her look to herself. And I say to thee calmly, sister,
thou must say all this to-night, else beware! Listen, I have but
one desire in life, that is Tara&mdash;one object only to live for, that is
Tara. I plead nothing, I say nothing, only that I am not mad.</p>

<p>"Now, listen again. You have much to live for&mdash;the pleasures
of life, the enjoyments of wealth&mdash;honour as the wife of Vyas
Shastree,&mdash;children to come, and your husband's love, with your
children's; but remember, Radha, they are all in my hand. A word
from me to him, and you are sunk lower than the Moorlees. All
this joy will pass from you. He will cast you out, and I will not
shelter you. You shall be worse than the vilest, and men shall
mock you. By &mdash;&mdash;" and he swore a horrible curse, "I will do this
and more, Radha, if you refuse. Answer me, girl," and he shook
her violently and painfully in his passion.</p>

<p>"Moro!" cried his sister, gasping for breath, "listen. I said once
before you might kill me if it pleased you, and I bared my breast to
you. Now again, if you dare to look at it without shame, it is
before you. But, listen to my words, I will do no treachery; no,
brother, no treachery. I am of the same blood and the same spirit
as yourself, and you well know I could be true and fearless once,
and so may God and the Mother help me, I will be fearless now in a
better cause. Yes, strike," she continued, as, without speaking, he
hastily raised himself, seized a naked dagger that was concealed
under his pillow, and brandished it with one hand, while he pressed her
down with his knee, and held her forcibly against the wall with the
other. "Strike! your blow will be more merciful than your words,"
and she shut her eyes, expecting the stroke, yet not flinching from it.</p>

<p>"Stay&mdash;hold!" cried a shrill woman's voice, as a hasty rustling of
silken garments was heard for an instant between the door and the
bed, and Moro Trimmul's hand was seized in a powerful grasp;
"wouldst thou do murder? Shame on thee, and she thy sister!"</p>

<p>"She is a devil, too, and mocked me," exclaimed the man moodily,
but dashing the knife to the ground. "Who let thee in, Gunga?
Go, I want thee not&mdash;away! tempt me no more, else I will strike!"</p>

<p>"Fear him not, lady," cried the girl, picking up the dagger hastily;
"he dare not strike you now, else,"&mdash;and her eyes flashed&mdash;"else,
Moro Trimmul, thou shalt do no more evil: none to me, none to her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
Beware! I have no fear, and no scruple; let her go safely, and I will
stay with thee."</p>

<p>"Go, Radha," he said. "Go, sister&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I will not go, Moro Trimmul," cried his sister excitedly. "I was
not afraid of you when that dagger's point was at my heart. For
myself I am not afraid of your threats, or your words. What you
can do to me, what you can say of me, I know not. Whatever it be,
and this girl is witness, I fear it not. What men would say of the
Pundit who wronged his sister&mdash;you know; and how they would
revile and spit at you. Say it, sir, and I follow you through Dekhan,
through Hind, till I die by your hand. If you make me shameless
you shall be shameless with me; but this remember, I warn them all
in the house of you,&mdash;I warn Tara of you,&mdash;and no harm shall come
to her, for your honour is dearer to me, than mine to you."</p>

<p>"If thou hast any influence over him," she continued to Gunga;
"lead him aright. Thou mayst have saved him a great crime to-day,
for there was blood in his eyes when he kneeled over me with
the knife; but better I should have died than harm should have come
to them through me. Lead him away from those evil thoughts, and
Radha will be grateful to thee all her life, and may often help thee."</p>

<p>"I love you, lady, and honour you," said the girl, reverently
touching Radha's feet; "but in this matter I have no power, much
as I desire to help you and him; nor, indeed, in any other now,&mdash;yet
I will do what I can. He loved me once," said the girl, bursting
into tears, "before he knew Tara; but that is gone, for she has his love
and cares not for it. Now he only curses me and beats me, yet I will
not, I cannot leave him, lady. Forgive the poor Moorlee; but it is
better for me to bear his wrath than for him to be left alone. Last
night he was fearfully excited, and threatened my life, but I escaped.
He grows worse towards evening; but fear not, I will not leave him."</p>

<p>"I will come and watch with thee," said Radha, in a whisper, for
her brother had again thrown himself on the bed, and covered himself
with a sheet, and she feared to excite him; "let me come?"</p>

<p>"It may not be, lady," replied the girl. "If he kill me, what
matter? who would miss the Moorlee, or grieve for her? But you,
his sister, must not meet this peril; the Holy Mother has already
saved you from one terrible danger, and fate is never to be dared
twice. Only believe that one as devoted as yourself watches him,
and one to whom life is of no account. Go, do not speak to him now.
This madness will pass away, and I will come and tell you of him."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"Is she gone, Gunga?" said Moro Trimmul to the girl, who, after
Radha's departure, had sat down by the bed and was fanning him.
"I hear no one speaking to you."</p>

<p>"Yes, I sent her away. I feared for her," she replied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span></p>

<p>"It was well done, Gunga, else&mdash;else I might have killed her&mdash;&mdash;Ay,
girl," he resumed, after a pause, "I had killed her but for Tara.
Why did she come and not stay? Why did she take the knife from
me?"</p>

<p>"Thou art always raving of that girl like a fool, Moro Trimmul,"
said Gunga impatiently. "It was I that saved thy sister, else there
was blood in thine eyes, and a devil at thy heart; what if thou hadst
struck her?"</p>

<p>"She and Tara are one," he said gloomily; "yes, they are one, and
thou, too, wilt go to them. Go, Gunga, they will give thee money."</p>

<p>"May dirt fall on their money, and thine too," she replied sulkily.
"I want none of it."</p>

<p>"Thou art insolent, girl."</p>

<p>"I am a fool, Moro Trimmul, to bear with thee," she retorted,
without moving. The girl's quick perception showed her that any
toleration of his bad humour would only increase it, and of life she
was utterly reckless. What tie held her to the man who now
seemed almost to loathe her, she knew not: a fascination, perhaps,
which she could not resist.</p>

<p>He was long silent, again drew the sheet over him, and lay quietly;
at length he removed it and sat up.</p>

<p>"Thou art not gone, Gunga?" he said; "why art thou here?"</p>

<p>"I know not," she returned, "except that I am a fool."</p>

<p>"Go," he continued, "they will be wanting thee in the temple."</p>

<p>"I am not going," she replied; "another will take my work. I
will not leave thee now."</p>

<p>"Gunga," he resumed, after a moody silence, "is there peace between
us?"</p>

<p>"Such peace as thou wilt have," she replied.</p>

<p>"And if I love thee again?"</p>

<p>"Pah!" she cried; "love!&mdash;it is a thing to spit upon now. Can
love go from one to another, and return as it went? Can a garland
of Champa flowers be worn all night, and keep their freshness and
fragrance till the morning? Do not men fling them away as refuse?"</p>

<p>"Then, why come to me, girl? why follow me?"</p>

<p>"Thy heart tells thee already," she said, fixing her eyes full on
him, "we have one thing only in common now. That girl&mdash;I told
thee so at the Pâp-nâs that day, and I tell thee so again&mdash;when I
trample that charm of hers under my feet, and her throat with it, I
shall be content, and thou art safe. Yes, Moro Trimmul, but for
hope of revenge on her, I would have killed thee when thy love went
to her. But thou art a coward; I know it; thou wilt do nothing."</p>

<p>"Thou wilt not say so if I carry her off and put her to shame."</p>

<p>"Ah!" cried the girl, rising and standing over him, "is it so? I
tell thee, Moro Trimmul, I will follow her and fawn on her like a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
dog&mdash;I will abase myself before her&mdash;I will lick the dust from her
feet, if that will help thee to do this."</p>

<p>"Listen to what I say," he continued, raising himself on his arm.
"I am calm now&mdash;quite calm&mdash;I burn no longer. I was mad when
she&mdash;when Radha&mdash;came. I thought I had a chance through her;
but she defied me, and there is none."</p>

<p>"Women know women best," said the girl. "I told thee so long
ago, but I was not believed."</p>

<p>"I believe thee now," he replied; "and we have only ourselves to
rely upon. Ah, surely this is a strange calmness which has come
over me. It is not before death, Gunga?"</p>

<p>"No, fear not," returned Gunga. "Love is passing into revenge;
I know what it is. Yes, thou wilt act now, Moro. Take her hence
but for a day, and she is thine for ever, and will become a Moorlee
like me&mdash;like the rest of us. Enough, Moro Trimmul. No other
harm shalt thou do to her than this? Hast thou the spirit&mdash;the
courage?"</p>

<p>"I will do it," he said gloomily. "That is what I had determined
on myself. When can it be done?"</p>

<p>"On the last night of the ceremonies," she said; "I can get the
key of the postern, and keep it open unobserved; and as Maloosray
and others went that night, so canst thou take Tara; and I have
friends among the Ramoosees, who will help us. I am their priestess,
and they dare not refuse me. Take us both; I must see her humiliation.
O Shakti powers!" she cried, stretching out her arms, "aid
me in this. Ye are more powerful than the Mother, and ye hate her.
Art thou determined, Moro Trimmul?"</p>

<p>"I will not change," he said; "the illusion is past."</p>

<p>"Swear on my throat and feet, and I will believe thee."</p>

<p>"I swear," he replied, touching her neck.</p>

<p>"Now I will leave thee, Moro," said the girl. "I have no fear for
thee; there will be no more delirium with new thoughts."</p>

<p>"I will follow thee to the temple," he replied; "go on before. I
dare not stay here alone; she would come to me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_LI" id="CHAPTER_LI">CHAPTER LI.</a></h2>


<p>Some days have passed at Beejapoor since we were last there, not
idly, certainly. A large army had to be prepared for the field, and
for a long, difficult, and perhaps hazardous service. The treasury
was opened, and the arrears of all troops disbursed; for the men had
to provide as well for their own wants as for those of their families
during their absence. The condition of the artillery was looked to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
with particular care, and preparations made for rough roads and
rougher service than other parts of the Dekhan afforded. Sivaji's
mountains were high and steep, the jungle and forest next to impenetrable,
yet Afzool Khan had taken up the "birra," the gage of
service, and had determined to bring the rebel bound to the throne
of his young King, there to receive death or pardon, as might be
most fitting.</p>

<p>But the old Khan was no boaster. He had seen something of that
country when, as a younger man, he had governed those provinces;
and in his tours through them had shared the hospitality of Shahji,
the father of Sivaji, and had been guided by Sivaji himself through
many a rough hunting expedition; he therefore remembered enough
to adopt precautions in all respects, and, so far as lay in his power,
they were made.</p>

<p>That was not a country for the operations of cavalry, and it was
therefore more to the infantry and artillery that he trusted: and it
would not be wise to weaken the royal forces in and about the capital
too much, lest the Moghuls should take advantage of it, and make
incursions across the frontier, nay, even attack the capital itself.</p>

<p>His own Paigah, and troops that had been in quarters for the rainy
season at his own town of Afzoolpoor:&mdash;some of the Wuzeer's
Abyssinian levies, which were at Nuldroog,&mdash;some bodies of the old
Dekhany horse under Alla-ool-Moolk, the Dâgtorays and Bylmees,
were particularly selected; and, with some of the best infantry, the
army was complete.</p>

<p>Nothing could exceed the spirit and devotion of the troops. In
the beautiful Jumma Mosque, where more than five thousand men
assembled daily for prayer, the preaching of the Peer, and the other
ecclesiastics of that noble edifice&mdash;which yet remains as perfect as it
was at the period of this history&mdash;eloquently set forth the merits of
the Jéhâd, or religious war, in the eyes of God and the Prophet; and
the certainty of paradise and its houris, to all who, falling by sickness
or in battle, would surely enjoy them. Nor was it in the Jumma
Mosque only that this fervour existed. In the royal Palace precincts,
the city mosques&mdash;at the tombs of the ancestors of the Kings&mdash;the
beauteous Ibrahim Roza, and noble mausoleum of Sultan Mahmood,
nothing was left undone by the preachers to make the war popular,
and to blacken the character and motives of the rebels. Frequently,
indeed, to such a pitch of excitement were men wrought, that it was
difficult to restrain them from attacking Hindus indiscriminately in
the streets, and, in the expressive language of the Peer, from "making
a pyramid of a lakh of heads before the palace gates." But it was
no part of the royal policy to allow such religious fury vent at the
capital or by the way: suffice it that, at the end of a long and toilsome
journey, which would be made light through religious fervour,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
there would be free licence to slay, and the raid of Afzool Khan
would become memorable in the history of the kingdom.</p>

<p>As the camps of the different leaders, too, formed without the walls,
on that great plain which encompassed the city, bards and minstrels,
in companies or singly, balled-singers, and, above all, troops of dancing
women&mdash;thronged to them; and day and night, audiences were
formed, sometimes in the tents, sometimes in the open air, where the
feats of Sivaji and Maloosray were sung in the native Mahratta or
Canarese, with verses added for the occasion, urging the faithful to
destroy them.</p>

<p>We may be sure that, if the old Khan and Fazil were active in the
field, Lurlee and Zyna were no less so in the house. To Lurlee war
was familiar. She had been long weary of a monotonous life in the
city, varied only by an occasional day's excursion to the royal palaces
at Toorweh, the Ibrahim Roza, or to the Khan's own garden, which
was without the walls; and she remembered vividly the time when,
for months together, the Khan's tent, or a temporary lodging in a
village, were her only home, moving hastily or leisurely, as the service
required, from place to place, in her palankeen or on horseback, as
might be.</p>

<p>Ah! she was young and active then, and with the sharing of a
rough bivouac or hurried march,&mdash;scanty food, often cooked by herself,
a horse-cloth to lie upon, and a shelter contrived with four
spears and a sheet thrown over them&mdash;and hard fighting to boot,&mdash;were
her pleasantest memories of the Khan's love and her own happiness.
If she were not so young, the old spirit was at last roused;
and, day by day, as the preparations went on, the good lady told Zyna
of the old wild times, and excited her desire to share in the new
expedition.</p>

<p>To Zyna's great joy her father had directed that the whole family
was to move. Lurlee was indispensable to the Khan in the field,
where, indeed, her truest value was apparent; and Fazil could not be
denied the command he had earned by his sagacity and valour. Who,
then, could protect Zyna, even did he desire to leave her? True, the
royal Bégum had offered a home, and with it her love to the maiden;
she should be her little secretary, and write the King's private letters
to her father while he was absent. But it could not be: that loving
heart would have pined without those whose daily converse had been
its life for years, and the invitation was affectionately but respectfully
declined.</p>

<p>We may, perhaps, also hint another reason, not more powerful,
certainly, than the love of those nearest and dearest to her, but
working with it, nevertheless, in no mean degree. Kowas Khan had
not suffered by his father's treachery. It was not only that Afzool
Khan and Fazil answered for him with their lives and honour; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
it had become clear to the King, and to those who had examined the
late Wuzeer's correspondence, that the son had been kept ignorant
of his father's plans; so, when the period of mourning was past,
Kowas Khan had been taken to the royal court by the Khan and his
son, and invested with robes of honour. Of the King's participation
in the secret of his father's murder Kowas Khan had no knowledge,
and could have none. It was believed to have been committed in
revenge by some discharged soldiers, and it were better that he died
as he had done, than that his treacherous intention should have
succeeded, or that the ignominy of a public execution should have
followed its detection.</p>

<p>While, therefore, the young man was still residing at the Khan's
house with his mother, and other younger members of the family, he
renewed his proposals for Zyna, which were heartily seconded by her,
and other female relatives. It was, however, no time for such affairs;
and with a tacit consent that, when the campaign was over, there
should be no more delay in the marriage, Kowas Khan contented
himself with being told by Lurlee Khánum&mdash;when the worthy dame
had retired behind a screen&mdash;that, after a strict investigation, she
had come to the conclusion that his temperament was fire and Zyna's
air, and that, in consequence, their union promised to be felicitous in
the highest degree; and that her friend the Moolla agreed with her.</p>

<p>Did our space admit of it, we would tell how friends on both sides
met for the betrothal; and how,&mdash;there being no time for more
lengthened ceremonies,&mdash;they stood up and interchanged packets of
betel-leaf covered with gold and silver foil. How both sides swore
that those they represented should never swerve from the contract;
how the first, and hundred and tenth chapters of the Kôrán, were
said devoutly by the Moolla and the assembly; and what good things
were provided at night by Lurlee Khánum and her trusty cook
Kurreema, for those who came to the quiet ceremony. Many were
the complaints of Lurlee's female friends, and perhaps Zyna's also,
that there was not greater rejoicing; but Afzool Khan made it known
that, when the marriage did take place, there should be no stint;
and so the neighbours were satisfied for the present, and consoled
themselves with hope for the future.</p>

<p>Bulwunt's wounds had proved of less consequence than was supposed
at first, and loss of blood had caused the weakness under
which he suffered on the night of the scene in the temple. He was
now able to move about, and even to ride, and in the ensuing campaign,
in a country which he knew thoroughly, his local experience
would be of great use. He was not, however, sanguine as to the
result. As he expressed it, hunting Sivaji and Maloosray would be
like chasing the wind; it would be heard and felt, but never seen.
Nevertheless they might be brought to terms, and hereafter become
worthy servants of the royal house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>

<p>Everything, therefore, being prepared, and the royal astrologers
having fixed a fortunate day and hour for the commencement of the
march, the whole of the troops were drawn out in battle-array on the
plain north of the fort, and the young King bade the leaders God-speed.
Descending from his elephant, he embraced the old Khan,
his son, and other noblemen and gentlemen of note; and as the royal
Nagárás, or kettle-drums, which had been directed to accompany
the force, struck up a march, and were answered by those of every
body of horse, infantry, and artillery on the field,&mdash;the troops at
once proceeded to their several destinations, a few miles distant,
shouting the war-cries of their several leaders.</p>

<p>It was necessary, however, for the Khan himself, with his son
and Kowas Khan, to visit Nuldroog, where a great portion of the
army lay, and whence some of it was to accompany him; for though
the troops at Beejapoor, which had been under the late Wuzeer, had
shown no signs of disaffection, those at the fort were suspected,
and their loyalty must be put to the proof ere the army could proceed.
Lurlee Khánum and Zyna, therefore, were despatched under
guidance and escort of Bulwunt Rao and others, to Sholapoor, to
await the Khan's arrival; and with a party of horse lightly equipped,
his son Fazil, the Peer&mdash;who had declared his intention of witnessing
in person the discomfiture of the infidels, and seeing to the religious
exercises of the army during its march&mdash;and Kowas Khan, Afzool
Khan proceeded by the direct road of his own town of Afzoolpoor to
the royal fort.</p>

<p>We need not follow their journey, for the country affords nothing
interesting or remarkable for description. After passing the town
of Almella, they crossed the Bheema, now falling rapidly, and already
fordable in some places for horsemen: and Afzoolpoor, lying near
the further bank, was safely reached on the third day.</p>

<p>Here the Khan found employment for two days more: for he was
in no hurry to leave his own town, and the various matters to which
he found he had to attend. His own last resting-place, a lofty, handsome,
square building, with a massive dome, and the mosque adjoining
it, were all but completed, and their consecration was necessary.
This was performed by the Peer, the Moollas of village mosques
around, the Kazee of Nuldroog, and the representative of the saint
Boorhan Sahib, who lived at the pretty village of Boorhanpoor, some
miles to the north, where the saint's tomb had been erected. "It
was well," said the old Khan, "to have the place ready; who could
tell whether it might not be required soon?" Who could tell indeed?
and so the ceremonies were completed.</p>

<p>Nor would the hospitable representative of the Boorhanpoor saint
allow the Khan's party to pass his village without entertainment.
Parties of leaders of the troops at Nuldroog, now only a few miles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
distant, came to the festivities, and, in the meeting with them, all
apprehensions were removed from the Khan's mind. Swearing on
the holy book before the saint's shrine, they declared their fealty to
the King, and their attachment to their young master, in terms
which could not be mistaken.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_LII" id="CHAPTER_LII">CHAPTER LII.</a></h2>


<p>The Khan was to march early next morning for the fort, but his
departure was delayed purposely to allow of the troops to send out
parties to perform the ceremony of "Istikbal," or meeting; and, after
again partaking of the good Durwaysh's hospitality, the party rode
on without interruption.</p>

<p>The road from Boorhanpoor to Nuldroog leads up the pretty and
fertile valley of the Bóree river, which is skirted by low grassy hills
for several miles. Then leaving the river, as the hills grow bolder, it
rises gradually through passes among them, and, after several steep
and stony ascents, gains a level plateau, from whence the fort and
town are distinctly seen below.</p>

<p>Soon after leaving their post, the party began to meet others from
the fort, dressed in their gayest and best costumes; and these,
having made their salutes to the Khan, rode forward to the front, so
that gradually the men in advance swelled to a considerable number,
and had all the appearance of an independent body of cavalry. Out
of this, wherever the ground afforded room, and was free from ruts
and stones, men dashed at speed, wheeling and circling their horses,
so that their movements appeared like those of a real skirmish.</p>

<p>When they reached the level plain on the summit of the plateau
above the town, the Khan was met by the Killadar, or governor of
the fort, the principal officers of the troops, the civil authorities, and
others; some on horseback, others on gaily-caparisoned elephants
with clashing bells. Both parties dismounting, and the leaders
having embraced each other,&mdash;the officers presenting the hilts of
their swords as Nuzzurs, or offerings to the Khan,&mdash;the procession&mdash;for
it had now become one&mdash;moved on slowly in gorgeous array,
amidst the firing of matchlocks and camel swivels and welcome guns
from the fort; and the appearance of the Khan and his gallant son,
as they rode together through the main street and bazar, dressed in
rich cloth-of-gold, was a subject of general remark and approbation
by all classes. The prospect of a campaign, always pleasant to the
soldiers, especially under so renowned a leader as Afzool Khan,
increased the general satisfaction of all concerned.</p>

<p>As they passed its first gate, the booming of cannon from the
ramparts announced their arrival within the fort, and was answered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
by guns from the encampment on the heights to the west. Passing
the ditch by a causeway, they entered the fausse-braye by a narrow
passage, and thence ascending slightly to the main entrance, with its
massive flanking bastions of black basalt, the interior was reached&mdash;at
that time a busy place, crowded with houses and shops in some
parts, but in others laid out in open gardens, and spaces where the
troops could assemble.</p>

<p>A curious and picturesque spot in many respects is this fort. Built
upon a tongue of basalt, which is precipitous on three sides, and of
considerable height, it is joined to the level portion of the plateau to
the west, on which the town stands, by a neck considerably narrower
than the enceinte; and on this side a double wall with bastions, and
a deep dry ditch, form the defences. Round the edge of the precipices
of the hill itself, is a single wall of great strength, with large
bastions at intervals; and the river Bóree, lying deep in the valley
below, washes the base of the hill on two sides, north and east.</p>

<p>To the north, to secure a constant supply of water to the fort, a
stupendous dam of masonry has been thrown across the river upwards
of seventy feet high, and of proportional thickness, by which the
water is held up in the valley, so as to form a pretty lake of the same
depth at the dam, which extends above the town. On the other side
of this dam is another fort on a smaller knoll, which serves as a <i>tête-de-pont</i>
to the dam, and completes the fortification.</p>

<p>To the old Khan the place was familiar. He had often taken
turns of duty there to watch the frontier, but to Fazil and his friend
it was new; and when ceremonies of reception and the introduction
of Kowas Khan to the officers of his father's levies, now his own, were
finished, the friends accepted the offer of the Killadar to examine the
marvels of the place.</p>

<p>The wonderful dam, through the upper sluices of which the stream
was precipitated into a deep pool at its foot, in two pretty cataracts;
the suite of apartments in the body of the dam itself, over which the
river rolled in flood, and fell in a sheet before its windows; and the
noble Cavalier at the east end, from the top of which extensive views
of the country on all sides were obtained, were duly admired. It
was evening when the friends reached the summit of the Cavalier,
and they sate there watching the glorious sunset, over town and fort
and lake, in which the piles of gold and crimson clouds broken with
dark purple, with the sombre masses of fort walls and bastions, and
precipices on which they stood, were reflected in its deep waters.</p>

<p>It was not so easy to prepare the troops required there as at the
capital; but the Khan was anxious that nothing should be wanting
in their equipment, and a few days was required to complete preparations
for the field. This delay enabled the chief officers of the
country to arrive and pay their respects, and, among others, Pahar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
Singh, no longer disguised, but in his proper character as one of the
wardens of the frontier marches, attended and did service with a
body of picked men, both horse and foot, which rivalled, if they did
not surpass, the royal troops in completeness and splendour of appearance.</p>

<p>Very different were the chief and his nephew now, in comparison
with the time when we last saw them; and in the noble figure,
dressed in light chain armour and cloth-of-gold, riding a superb grey
horse, and giving commands to his men, no one could have recognized
the old ragged Fakeer and his cry of "Ulla dilâyâ to léonga," which
still often rang in the ears of those who had heard it.</p>

<p>The building, which went by the name of the King's Palace, and
which was kept for the use of royal officers of rank, or even for
royalty itself, should the King have occasion to visit the fort, had
been assigned to Afzool Khan and his retinue; and, after the transaction
of daily business in one of the public halls of the fort, he
retired, after evening prayer, to his apartments, finding relaxation in
a game of chess with the priest, who was a stout opponent, or hearing
or dictating his public correspondence.</p>

<p>It was the fourth evening after his arrival, after an unusually busy
day; the priest was occupied with a sermon in the mosque, and the
Khan had retired into one of the rooms of the house, which, being
built into part of the fort wall, possessed a projecting oriel window,
commanding a view of the whole of the east side of the fort, with its
walls and rugged cliffs. By day these precipices did not appear
extraordinarily remarkable; but when shrouded in the gloom of
evening and night, with the river brawling beneath them in its rocky
bed, their height and effect were indefinitely increased, and the
murmur of the river below became delightfully soothing.</p>

<p>One corner of this oriel, furnished with cushions, had become the
favourite resort of the Khan. Here he had been sitting alone and
undisturbed, and occupied with despatches and other papers the whole
of the evening; and he was about to retire to rest when an attendant
entered, somewhat abruptly.</p>

<p>"I said I was not to be disturbed, Allee," he cried; "what dost
thou want?"</p>

<p>"My lord, there is a man without, who says he has urgent business,
and he must have speech of you alone. I said it was impossible;
but he declared you would be angry with me if you knew he were
denied, and that I was to say to you, 'Ulla dilâyâ to léonga,' and you
would understand."</p>

<p>"Admit him, instantly," said the Khan, to his servant's astonishment.
"Ha, Pahar Singh again! what new work has he now got
here for us?"</p>

<p>Muffled closely in a sheet, with his sword under his arm, the chief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
approached the Khan, and bent lowly before him. "Send that man
away, and hear what I have to say," he said; "it is important."</p>

<p>Allee looked at the chief suspiciously, as though he were trusting
his master to a dangerous character; but, at a reiteration of the
order, he returned to depart.</p>

<p>"Take this weapon with you, friend," said the chief, laughing,
"thou art afraid of it, perhaps; not so thy lord,&mdash;nor of me. Keep
it for me, however, till I come out."</p>

<p>Allee took the sword. "I did not like the look of him," he said
to another without, who belonged to the fort. "Who is he?"</p>

<p>"Dost thou not know Pahar Singh?" returned the man; "that
is his famous sword Dévi, which has drank many a man's blood;
come, let us look at it. There will be something to do, surely, as he
is with the Khan."</p>

<p>"I have but a few words to say, Afzool Khan," said Pahar Singh,
as the servant retired; "and I can do a good service, if it please you,
my lord, to join in it or aid it."</p>

<p>"If it be a service to the King's cause, why not?" said the Khan;
"but none of thy blood feuds, Pahar Singh; thou canst not use the
royal troops for thine own purposes."</p>

<p>"Nor do I need them, my lord," returned the chief, somewhat
stiffly. "I have enough men of my own to answer for those matters;
nay, indeed, for this also, if I have your permission; and only that
my rascals are somewhat too free of hand to be trusted in a town at
night, I had done it myself ere this."</p>

<p>"Thanks, friend, for thy caution," said the Khan, smiling; "we
shall know each other better by-and-by. But what is this scheme?"</p>

<p>"When I left you, Khan Sahib, the night of Jehándar Beg's
execution," replied the chief, "I had knowledge that Tannajee Maloosray
was in the city, and I knew where he was. My people watched
every bazar and street during the day, and we had a strong party near
the Goruk Imlee trees, thinking he might like to come and see an old
friend for the last time; but he kept close, like a bear in his den, till
night, and then stole away. My boy and some of my people wanted
to catch him in his den; but I knew Tannajee could not be taken
alive by mortal, and I wanted to see him sit like Jehándar Beg under
the trees, and die like a man; so I took a body of my horse and rode
after him towards Tooljapoor, where he was going. We occupied
the pass at Hórtee. But he escaped us there, Khan; and hearing
afterwards he had gone to Jutt, there appeared to be no use in following
him, as he had twenty-five coss start of us. But I was a fool,
my lord; and for once Tannajee outwitted me. He went on next
day to Tooljapoor; how, I know not. He was seen there in the temple,
and he left again that night, no one knows whither."</p>

<p>"To Tooljapoor in one day!" exclaimed the Khan, "no horse alive
could do it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah, my lord, your high-fed beasts would not, but ours can; and
Tannajee and his friend Netta Palkur have the best mares in the
Dekhan. No matter; he escaped us."</p>

<p>"He was&mdash;he is&mdash;the very bone and sinew of this rebellion," said
the Khan.</p>

<p>"True, as Sivaji Rajah is the spirit; but he left some of the bones
behind him at Tooljapoor," returned the chief, with a grim smile;
"and I can pick them up for you, my lord, if you will either help me
or let me do it alone as best I can; only remember, if the town is
plundered, you know the cause, and I am not responsible for the
blame."</p>

<p>"That you had better avoid, friend," said the Khan, "you are badly
spoken of already. But the bones, good fellow, the bones! who or
what are they?"</p>

<p>"Ah! I had forgotten them," continued Pahar Singh. "Well,
there is Moro Trimmul, Maloosray's agent and shadow; as wily, and
more mischievous. He is still at Tooljapoor, pretending to give
recitations,&mdash;and they are very good, my lord, in their way,&mdash;and to
serve at the temple; but I am not sure that one of the Moorlees is
not at the bottom of it, and when a man gets into women's hands, he
is easily caught. Then there are all those who will assemble there.
Have you remarked, my lord, that hardly one of the heads of the old
Mahratta families have come to present their Nuzzurs to you?"</p>

<p>"I have remarked it," returned the Khan, "but supposed they
were afraid of some demand for forage, or horses, or money, and
therefore kept clear of me."</p>

<p>"Not at all," returned the chief, "they have all sworn to aid
Sivaji, and Maloosray took an account of their quotas of horse and
foot with him to the Rajah."</p>

<p>"Then they met Maloosray?"</p>

<p>"They did, my lord, the night he came to the temple, and here are
their names. There are other people, you see, who have ears and
eyes besides Maloosray; and only that your Näik at Tooljapoor is an
owl, he had seen this conspiracy long ago, while I was too busy to
watch it. Better, perhaps, he did not; we can do our work more
securely. And now, do you wish to seize this gang of rebels or not?
I advise you to do so, because they are strong, and, should there be
any difficulties in the West, are capable of making a serious diversion,
especially if Maloosray, or even this Brahmun,&mdash;who is more of a
soldier than a priest,&mdash;get among them. These Nimbalkurs and
Ghoreparays, my lord, quiet as they look, are heavily supported by
the people; and if the Ramoosees rise with them, the country will be
in a flame."</p>

<p>"And how dost thou know all this, Pahar Singh?" asked the
Khan. "I must have some warranty that it is true."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span></p>

<p>"Some months ago, my lord," he replied, "this very Moro Trimmul
and others canvassed me as to joining Sivaji's band, and offered
me whatever terms I pleased to ask. I refused, for I was content as
I was."</p>

<p>"That means," remarked the Khan dryly, "that thou wouldst
have joined them if there had been anything to be got by it."</p>

<p>"My lord is still incredulous," returned the chief, "and perhaps I
deserve doubt till I have given him further proof. But I feel the
King's hand on my head still, and his pardon is more to me than
promises, of Mahratta, or Moghul either."</p>

<p>"Good!" said the Khan; "it is well said, and I believe thee. But
about these rebels; are they still there? and how many may there be
of them?"</p>

<p>"They are there, my lord," replied the chief. "I was in the
temple last night disguised as a Byragee, with my nephew and four
others: we heard the recitations from the Ramayun, which, to
Hindus, are very much what the Peer Sahib is saying now in the
mosque yonder, and said yesterday at the Eedgah on the plain, when
the whole force shouted 'Deen, deen!' and it sounded like thunder.
Jey Rao Nimbalkur was there, and some of the Kallays&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How many?" said the Khan, impatiently interrupting him;
"what care I for their teeth-breaking names?"</p>

<p>"Five hundred perhaps, including followers."</p>

<p>"And is this temple a strong place? Do we require guns?"</p>

<p>"Strong enough to defend if they knew you were coming,"
returned Pahar Singh, "but for the most part they will be unarmed,
and looking at the show. We need only cavalry to surround the
town, and no one can escape us. No guns, my lord; they could not
be taken up the mountain at night, and ours must be a surprise, else
the temple will be dark as midnight."</p>

<p>"Ya Alla! ya Kabiz!" (destroyer of enemies), muttered the Khan
to himself, "a rare trap for these Kaffirs&mdash;let them die! Good," he
continued; "it shall be done; but when? I should march to-morrow
for Sholapoor."</p>

<p>"Do so, my lord, and halt at Tandoolwaree; 'tis half way. I will
join you there with some of my people the day after to-morrow, and
lead you by a pass in the hills which I know of at night, so that we
can surround the place unobserved. Take some of your own men
and Ibrahim Khan's Abyssinians; they know no fear, and are more
certain than the braggart, plundering Dekhanies, who are afraid of
the Mother who sits in the glen, though they are Mussulmans."</p>

<p>"What Mother, friend?"</p>

<p>"Only she in the temple; we Hindus call her the 'Mother'; and
she, my lord, must not be touched."</p>

<p>"No, no; nor her people, I will see to that," said, the Khan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span></p>

<p>"And the affair must be kept secret, Khan," he continued.</p>

<p>"It is known to thee and me, Pahar Singh, and to no one else;
not even my son shall know of it till we march."</p>

<p>"Now let me depart," said the chief, "and the night after next I
will come."</p>

<p>"God willing," replied the Khan, dismissing his strange visitor
with a courteous salutation.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_LIII" id="CHAPTER_LIII">CHAPTER LIII.</a></h2>


<p>On her return home, Tara being still asleep, Radha could not conceal
from Anunda the agitation which the scene with her brother had
caused her. As she reached the inner apartments, she threw herself
upon Anunda's neck, and the terror she felt at what she considered a
narrow escape from death, found relief in a flood of tears. The particulars
of that scene she dared not fully relate: but Anunda gathered
enough from her to believe that Moro Trimmul had threatened, if not
struck his sister, and that Tara's suspicions were but too deeply
founded.</p>

<p>If Anunda had not felt assured of Tara's purity and devotion to
the worship of the goddess, in its spiritual sense only, she would
have prevented, at all hazards perhaps, her assumption of service as
a devotee. It was, she knew, one of the trials to which the girl
would be subject so long as her beauty remained, that her public
avocation would expose her to the gaze of all classes of people&mdash;the
most persistent and dangerous libertines, perhaps, being priests of her
own sect. But the act of Tara's profession of service was so sudden,
so unlooked for, and had been carried out so immediately, that there
was no time to consider the consequences.</p>

<p>Now, too, it was impossible to recede. Once she had vowed herself
to the dread goddess she dared not retract, nor could any attempt
be made, as they believed, to withdraw her without danger. Many
instances of such partial service and relinquishment of it, capricious
or meditated, had come to her knowledge, which had been followed by
sudden death, or, what was worse, loss of reason and raving madness.</p>

<p>Well, therefore, might the sister-wives tremble at the consequences
of transgression, even by temporary withdrawal of Tara's service.
It was the first thing that Radha counselled; but, under the instances
of punishment which she enumerated, Anunda declared it to be
impossible. She could not&mdash;dare not&mdash;expose Tara to such risk,
nor herself be the means of it; and, indeed, she was assured that
Tara would never agree. Gradually, however, Anunda's naturally
cheerful and sanguine spirit took courage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span></p>

<p>"We cannot prevent men's eyes wandering to that sweet face," she
said to Radha, as she gently waved a fan over Tara, who still slept
heavily, "no more than I can prevent them looking at me if they like,
or thee, Radha; but we can protect her from insult and shame, and
she is too pure to be approached or spoken to. No; he may look as
he pleases, but he dare not speak to her: for thy sake, for the sake
of his own honour and station as a priest, he dare not; and his looks
she shall not fear&mdash;I will prevent them."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless," replied Radha, "let her not visit the temple for
several days to come, or, if she goes, we will both accompany her.
This will give her fresh assurance, and in a few days he will be
gone."</p>

<p>Radha, however, knew her brother well&mdash;better than Anunda.
She knew that, with any scheme against Tara in view, no matter
what it might be, she was incapable of watching him so completely
as to defeat his intentions; but she could at least be wary, and gain
information of them, and a small purse of money with which Anunda
supplied her, given to Chimna, gained her constant information
of her brother's movements, such as she could not otherwise have
obtained.</p>

<p>Moro Trimmul, however, to all appearance ceased to pursue Tara.
For several days she did not visit the temple. She herself feared
collision with him, and kept away. But gradually, a sense of neglect
of her daily duty, the loss of the satisfaction which had resulted from
it, and the dread of offending the terrible Being in whose exacting
service she believed,&mdash;wrought on her mind so as to render inaction
intolerable.</p>

<p>And no wonder now. Her own small household tasks, which had
previously occupied her leisure hours, had been resigned to Radha;
the temple service required her presence for the greater part of the
morning and afternoon; and her studies, and some needful rest,
absorbed the remainder of the day. Now that she remained idle at
home, therefore, the time hung heavy on her hands, and she sighed
for the occupation and excitement which had become habitual to her;
while the yearning to serve "the Mother"&mdash;never to be absent from
her&mdash;grew stronger and stronger day by day, with a fascination she
could not resist. Day by day those weird, glowing, eerie eyes
seemed to follow her about, seek her in her sleep, and by turns
threaten or entreat her.</p>

<p>"Mother," she said at last, and after a few days had passed in
restless idleness at home, "I feel that my life here is not what it was.
The Mother's eyes follow me, and she sits at my heart day and night.
Why dost thou not come to me, Tara? she says; fear not, but come;
no one dare harm thee, and I would have thee near me. This she
whispers daily when my time of service comes, and I am here and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
not with her. O mother, I fear no longer; she gives me strength,
and I will go. What can he do to me? The dread of him is gone
from me."</p>

<p>"We will go with thee, daughter," replied Anunda, "and remain
with thee daily. Before us, he dare neither look nor speak; and
perhaps, too, thy suspicions were misplaced."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," she replied; "and why should he do me wrong? I
should be sorry if I had thought ill of him without a cause."</p>

<p>So they went. The first day Moro Trimmul was not there. On
the second they met him, and received his distant and courteous
salutation. He did not even come to speak to his sister, and turned
away directly. Gunga was present on both occasions; and on the
first day Tara was surprised, and perhaps somewhat gratified, by the
manner in which she and some of her sisterhood met her; offered
her garlands of flowers, even put them into her hands, and tied them
like bracelets round her arms, and into her hair.</p>

<p>"You have been ill, sister," said Gunga, deferentially and respectfully,
"and we have done your work, and offered flowers for your
recovery to the Mother. Ah," she continued, "because we are poor,
and not as you are, Tara, do not look coldly upon us; have we not
one common Mother, and are we not sisters in her? So think of us,
and we will be your slaves and fellow-servants; for she has loved
you more than us, and sent you pure among us. We know, too, you
are already changed to us, for we have received the daily offerings
as you have kindly directed."</p>

<p>Poor Tara, there was no guile in her loving heart which bred or
fostered suspicion. What could she think but that those callous
minds had relented towards her? and perhaps the very offerings,
which she had thoughtlessly made over to the attendant priests, had
been the original cause of all their apparent enmity. Day after day
the Moorlees' respect seemed to increase; and while her work was
rendered lighter, her repugnance to acknowledge them as co-servitors
seemed to lessen. With all indeed, except Gunga, the respect was
sincere, and the deference unfeigned; but with her, intercourse
seemed only to fan the flame of revenge burning at her heart: and
while she repressed it with difficulty in public, in private she yielded
to it with all the unbridled rancour and jealousy of her nature.</p>

<p>Against Tara, therefore, these evil notions were now, for different
reasons, in perpetual and active combination. It was no part of
Moro Trimmul's plan to excite further suspicion. Brooding over
fancied neglects and slights, as well as revenge for hopelessness of
passion, had, as Gunga rightly guessed, mastered the softer feeling
of admiration and love for the gentle object of them; and the desire
of his life now was, to crush relentlessly and deface the purity which
he could not appreciate. His sister, he believed, had kept his counsel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
for she had made no further remonstrance; and the first occasion on
which Tara came with her father only, and trusted herself to the
companionship of the priestesses, was hailed by Gunga and the
Brahmun as conducive to their success.</p>

<p>We can believe that the worthy Shastree himself was utterly
unconscious of any element of disturbance in his quiet household.
He was perfectly satisfied with his new wife, and was even growing
to love her dearly. He was not demonstrative&mdash;very learned and
studious men rarely are so, perhaps; but Radha studied his disposition
and his wants, and, without interfering with Anunda's
prerogatives, was supplying them unobtrusively and lovingly; and
he felt what he could not fail to appreciate&mdash;the action of another
tender hand about his daily life.</p>

<p>With Moro Trimmul he continued on the best of terms&mdash;nay, his
love and admiration of the man was much increased. These recitations
in the temple, the disputations on logic and law, the evident knowledge
which Moro possessed of the more secret rites and mysteries of
the Shasters and Tantras, increased the Shastree's respect. If Moro
Trimmul would not come to the house as often as he wished, he was
at least no stranger in the temple, and in the ceremonies now proceeding,
he was of the greatest possible use. He now frequently
spoke of his approaching departure, which only depended upon letters
he should receive from his Prince; and it was an event which, on
every account of private and public intercourse, Vyas Shastree was
disposed to regret exceedingly.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_LIV" id="CHAPTER_LIV">CHAPTER LIV.</a></h2>


<p>The night of the Amáwas, or that which immediately precedes the
new moon, is necessarily the darkest of every month, and for several
days previous to it the sky had been overcast, as it frequently is at
the season we write of, though without rain. The ceremonies in the
temple would be protracted till, according to the astronomical calculations,
the old moon had passed away and the new one begun,
which was some time after midnight. The concourse in the town
was perhaps greater than usual. Several of the Mahratta chiefs
were still there, each with a complement of followers; and others
who lived within a day's journey, were arriving one by one, to attend
the last series of recitations which would be given until the next
full moon. It was understood, also, that this was the last night on
which Moro Trimmul would officiate; and his picturesque style of
declamation was more attractive than the measured and monotonous
manner of the elder Pundits.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span></p>

<p>By the afternoon, therefore, the main bazar of Tooljapoor had
become a very lively scene. The number of people already in the
town was increased hourly by the arrival of visitors from the populous
villages round about, and even from Darasew, Thair, Baimlee, and
others within a day's ride; and as evening drew in, the passes leading
to the town from below, and the roads, too, from the level country
above, still showed parties,&mdash;some on horses, some on ponies, on foot,
or on oxen,&mdash;pressing forward to be in time for the opening ceremonies,
which would commence as the lamps were lighted.</p>

<p>Sweetmeat-sellers&mdash;parched rice&mdash;and chenna friers, were driving
a brisk trade in the bazars, and their booths were crowded with
customers receiving their several quantities hot and hot, as they
could be prepared. The night would be far advanced ere the whole
of the ceremonies were concluded, and, once seated, no one could
move. Many a careful dame, therefore, had tied up a bundle of
sweet cakes before she left home and carried them on her arm;&mdash;others,
with less foresight perhaps, were making provision for the night at
the stalls we have mentioned:&mdash;while flower-sellers were threading
garlands of jessamine and môtea blossoms, and, indeed, of many
wild flowers, from fields and hedges, in lack of other materials.
Sellers of Pân leaves, tobacco and betel-nut&mdash;incense-sticks and
pastiles&mdash;and oil for the lights of the shrine&mdash;were all as busy as a
throng of eager purchasers could make them.</p>

<p>Among this crowd, the Shastree, with Anunda, Radha, and Tara,
were making their way to the temple before the assembly should
render the courts impassable. With the Shastree, who was walking
before the women, was Moro Trimmul, who had dined at his house,
and who was now on his way with him to the recitation. Chimna,
two days before, had reported to Radha that her brother was about
to leave. He had, the man said, purchased a palankeen and hired
a set of bearers for it, and others had been sent on the road to
Sattara, so as to form relays for a night's journey: and, except himself,
and one or two who were to be mounted, the other servants were
to follow. Indeed, intimation of his intended departure had been
made that day privately to the Shastree and to his sister by Moro
himself.</p>

<p>He was afraid of staying, he said. Afzool Khan had arrived at
Nuldroog; the force there was about to march to Sholapoor, and
thence westward. If he preceded it, he could travel unnoticed, otherwise
it would be impossible to move at all in its rear, or to pass it
without making a considerable and inconvenient detour. As danger
threatened the Maharaja, he must be present to share it; and he would
return as soon as the storm, which was about to burst, had blown over.</p>

<p>It was no more than all had expected and some had hoped for.
So long as her brother's presence was a source of no actual uneasiness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
to Radha, she was thankful to see him, although she feared a renewal
of his threats to her as regarded Tara; but since her last interview
with him, she had been possessed with a dread which beset her
night and day, either that he would do something desperate, as
regarded Tara, or that, in revenge for her not having assisted his
licentious purpose, he would put his threat, as regarded herself,&mdash;whatever
it might be,&mdash;in execution.</p>

<p>His proposed departure was, therefore, a positive relief, and, in
making the communication to her, Moro Trimmul had carefully
acted his part. He deplored the recent scene and his own violence.
"Tara's love," he said, "was hopeless as it was criminal; and he
thanked his sister for having saved his honour in regard to that misplaced
affection. Girls who married could not always keep their
relatives with them: better indeed it were so, and in her case particularly;
for no doubt he had enemies, and were he denounced to
Afzool Khan, he should have some difficulty in escaping."</p>

<p>Could any one have doubted all this, or suspected that any sinister
motive lay below it? Impossible! It was the literal truth in most
respects, and open to no breath of suspicion.</p>

<p>To Anunda, and especially to Tara, the event was one of positive
rejoicing. The good matron had, as we have seen, no objection to
Moro Trimmul until Tara's suspicion had been aroused; and, secure
in the effect of her own precautions, she had become utterly indifferent
whether he remained or not. But with Tara it was otherwise;
his presence was the only check on her enjoyment of daily life.
Were he gone for good, her services, her household love, would be
freed from the incubus which had deadened her existence while he
remained, and she would be saved from any apprehension for the
future. On all these considerations, therefore, the female members
of the Shastree's family descended to the temple that night, with
joyful and thankful hearts.</p>

<p>We know, however, partly what Moro Trimmul had determined
upon, and how he had proposed to execute it. So far as she was
concerned, the girl Gunga had never faltered in her plan. The only
stipulation she made with Moro Trimmul was, that she should
accompany him,&mdash;an arrangement to which he was very unwilling to
consent. On this point, however, he found her utterly unrelenting.
When she saw his desire to be rid of her, she declared that she would
not only retire from the affair altogether, but would denounce him to
the Shastree and to every Brahmun in Tooljapoor. She defied his
threats; and he knew, by previous experience, that no words could
turn her from any purpose which she had in view, and without her
co-operation the execution of the plan was quite impossible. What
she proposed to do he knew not, she would not tell him; but he had
provided a stout horse for her which, with his servants and the litter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
were to wait in the ravine below the temple. He did not fear pursuit.
The Shastree kept no horse. He could not obtain the services of any
horsemen from the authorities at night. Who would care for the
ravings of a Brahmun, whose daughter, a priestess of the temple, had
eloped, as it would be considered, with her lover? True, Anunda
might revenge herself on Radha,&mdash;but to that, the Shastree, for his
own honour, would hardly consent.</p>

<p>So they descended the steps into the lower court of the temple
together; and while Tara, her mother, and the Shastree entered the
vestibule to make their salutation to the goddess, Moro Trimmul
excused himself on pretence of bringing his books, and went round
to the back of the shrine, where, near the wishing-stone,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> he found
Gunga and several of the priestesses sitting idly on the basement,
basking, as it were, in the evening sun then setting. We have said it
had been a gloomy day, even now the heavens were overcast: but
towards the horizon the clouds were open, and a bright gleam of red
light had broken through them and fell upon the temple and sides
of the glen in striking brilliancy; while the rich dresses of the girls,
and their heavy gold and silver ornaments, glistened and sparkled in
the glowing colour.</p>

<p>Gunga had apparently been giving some description of her new
gold anklets; for, as Moro Trimmul turned the corner, she had slid
down from her seat, and was moving her feet as to produce a faint
clashing sound.</p>

<p>"One need not even put on the bells with these," she cried to her
friends, "listen how well they will sound to the music, and I shall
dance to-night as the processions move round."</p>

<p>As she spoke, the girl swayed round several times, half circling
one way, then another, tossing her arms in the air in time with the
steps in which she was moving her feet. There was something in
the lithe grace of her figure which struck Moro Trimmul as a new
charm, and he stopped to watch it for a few moments ere he was
noticed. Perhaps the thought she was not observed, perhaps the
certainty that she should that night triumph over her rival, had excited
Gunga more than usual; for she had thrown into her movements
a spirit and beauty,&mdash;a majesty of motion,&mdash;as it might be called,
which was inexpressibly attractive.</p>

<p>"If thou dance like that to-night," cried one of the girls, "thou
wilt win back that lover of thine, Gunga. If he were mine I should
not quarrel with him. Ah!" she screamed, "there he is: what if
he has heard me!" and, sliding hastily from their seats, she, with
the rest of her companions, fled round the corner of the building.</p>
<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span></p>
<p>Gunga did not move, but covered her face with the end of her
garment.</p>

<p>"If I had known&mdash;&mdash;" she said.</p>

<p>"Thou wouldst not have danced so well," he returned, interrupting
her. "By Krishna! girl, not even the Gopîs of Muttra danced more
lovingly before him than thou didst then in those few turns. Dance
like that to-night, and I shall not be able to resist thee."</p>

<p>"It would be a pity to turn thee from Tara now," she said, with
scorn, "so I shall not dance at all. Art thou ready?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I have taken leave of them, and prepared everything," he
replied. "Chimna will bring the horses and litter into the ravine,
and wait near the steps for us. Thou hast the key?"</p>

<p>"Look," she cried, crossing to the door, which was only a few
steps distant, and partly opening it, "it is already open, and the key
is here in my bodice. We can lock it outside, and throw the key
into the bushes. When I beckon to thee, come, for I will entice her
here; but if thy heart then fail thee, Moro Pundit, beware&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He had need in truth to do so; but there was no occasion for
threats, they did but provoke him. "Enough," he said, "we must
not be seen together here. I will not fail thee."</p>

<p>Just then, a company of well-equipped horsemen, in number about
two hundred, rode into Afzool Khan's camp at Tandoolwaree; and
the same gleam of sun, which had broken through the clouds and
shone on the temple at Tooljapoor, and upon Gunga as she danced,
caught the tips of their long spears,&mdash;and sparkled upon matchlock
barrels, the bright bosses of their shields, and the steel morion of the
leader.</p>

<p>There was no regularity of dress or equipment among the horsemen,
but the fine condition and spirit of their horses, and the manner
in which they moved, proved them to be accustomed to act together,
as the look of the men gave assurance of their being well tried in
war. In their front was a man on a piebald horse, over which were
slung two large kettle-drums, which were occasionally beaten with a
sonorous sound by the person who sat behind them: and two men,
both round-shouldered, one of whom carried a small green standard,
with a white figure of Hunoomán, the monkey god, sewn upon it,
rode beside him, one on each side. Pahar Singh was true to his word;
and, entering the camp at a time when his arrival would create no
particular observation, proceeded to some vacant ground in a field on
the west side of it, where, drawing up his men, he bid them dismount,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
and, without unsaddling their horses, tether them and await his
coming.</p>

<p>"What is the uncle about to-night?" said our old friend, Lukshmun,
to the kettle-drummer, as the halt was made, "and why do we
stop here? He told us we were to go on to Sholapoor, to prepare
forage for the Khan's army."</p>

<p>The man laughed. "Ah, brother!" he said, "dost thou not yet
understand the uncle's ways? Now, to my perception, as he has come
to the west of the camp, we shall have to go east. Home, perhaps,
who knows?&mdash;the devil,&mdash;if this be one of his errands,&mdash;as it most
likely is. Certain we have something to do out of the common way,
else he would not have stayed apart all day nor picked the men and
the mares; nor would he have brought you and Rama and the young
master. Well, we shall soon see, for he has gone off to the Khan's
tents, where a Durbar appears to be going on."</p>

<p>"Yes, he may be waiting for orders," returned the hunchback.
"May the Mother give him luck of them;&mdash;better luck than we had
in that wild ride after Maloosray, when neither mud, nor stones, nor
rivers, stopped us; and when we drew breath at the Hórtee pass,
you could have heard the mares breathing and snorting a coss off!
That was not the way to catch Maloosray! Yes, he had done too
much that day; and the blood had got up into his eyes and head,"
he continued, after a pause, and wagging his head wisely, "but he is
cool now; what will he do?"</p>

<p>"Something," said his companion; "what do we care? Now,
help me to get these kettles off the mare's back, Lukshmun, else I
shall be whipped if he comes and finds them on. Ho, Rama, come
and help, brother. What ails thee? art drunk?"</p>

<p>"May thy tongue rot," replied that worthy, dismounting from his
mare; "who told thee I was drunk?"</p>

<p>"Well, then, art thou sober? if that please thee better," returned
the man, laughing. "But what ails thee? thou hast not spoken a
word since we set out."</p>

<p>"No matter, my eyes are blinded with blood," returned Rama
sulkily. "What we are to do to-night will be evil. I saw an omen
I did not like before we set out, and three hares have crossed us since.
Is that good? I tell thee I cannot see in that direction," and he
pointed to the west, "for the blood that is in my eyes."</p>

<p>"The sun is bright enough, Rama," said Lukshmun, laughing,
"and the liquor was strong, brother. Thou wilt see better by-and-by,
when the night falls."</p>

<p>"Peace, ill-born," cried Rama, aiming a blow at him with his spear-shaft;
"only thou art my brother I had put it into thee."</p>

<p>"Ill or well born, we came of the same mother," retorted Lukshmun;
"as for me, with this hunch on my back, by the gods, thou<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
sayest true. But go to sleep, my friend, and get the blood out of
thine eyes; I like it not. He is generally right when he says this,"
continued Lukshmun to the kettle-drummer. "Yes, we shall have
work to do, and some of us may have to sup with the gods to-night.
I pray it may not be Rama, for his wife is a devil; and as for his
children&mdash;cubs of a wolf are easier to manage."</p>

<p>Leaving these worthies to discuss the probabilities of the night,
which was also the theme of conversation among the men, we may
follow Pahar Singh and his nephew to the Durbar tent; where,
seated at its entrance, were Afzool Khan, his son, the Peer, and
other officers of the force, enjoying, as it were, the cool breeze of
evening; while reports were heard and read, papers signed, and
orders given. Carpets had been spread for some: others sat on the
bare ground, or on their saddle-cloths, removed for the purpose. All
seemed merry, and the Khan's face was beaming with pleasure. He
was, in truth, enjoying his old life, and his spirits had risen with it,
with the hope, not only that Pahar Singh would not fail him, but in
the capture of the chief malcontents of those provinces, that he
should strike a deep blow at the root of the widespread Mahratta
confederacy.</p>

<p>Pahar Singh and his nephew dismounted, and, advancing, offered
the hilts of their swords to the Khan and those near him in succession,
and while receiving and replying to their welcome, took their
seats among the rest. "Our time will come, Gopal," said the chief;
"wait patiently, they will send for us after the evening prayer."</p>

<p>He was right. As the sun set, the assembly broke up. Performing
their ablutions, as a priest sang the Azân, or invitation to prayer,
they again collected, marshalled by the Peer, who took his seat in
front, looking towards Mecca. All present, joined by hundreds of
others from the camp, knelt on the ground in ranks, and obeying his
movements, rose&mdash;bowed themselves&mdash;or kneeled, in unison&mdash;as the
various changes of the Moslem liturgy required. When the service
was over, all, wishing each other peace, with the blessing of God and
the Prophet, separated for the night.</p>

<p>"Come into my tent," said the Khan to Pahar Singh, "thou art
welcome. What of the work?"</p>

<p>"I am ready," he said; "I have two hundred of my best people
with me."</p>

<p>"And I am not behind thee; my people are ready also, and wait
thy pleasure," replied the Khan.</p>

<p>"Who is this, father?" cried Fazil, who now entered, having
remained to speak with some friends. Fazil had not recognized the
Fakeer of the King's Durbar, nor the Jogi of the temple; but there
was a vague impression on his mind that he had seen the face under
other circumstances.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span></p>

<p>"Pahar Singh, son; dost thou not know him?" he replied.</p>

<p>"A brave youth, the worthy son of a brave sire, may not object to
receive the offering of an old soldier," said the chief, putting out his
sword-hilt to Fazil, who touched it courteously; "and he shall have
his share of the work if he may, Khan Sahib."</p>

<p>"What work? what is this?" whispered Fazil to his father, and
taking him a step aside. "Do not trust him&mdash;he is one of them&mdash;all
men say so. He is not true."</p>

<p>"He is as true as I am," replied the Khan. "I have already
proved him, and thou wilt know all by-and-by. He has received the
King's pardon, and confirmation of all his possessions. Do not
doubt him, for he can render important service."</p>

<p>"Enough, father," said Fazil aloud; and, turning to Pahar Singh,
"Where you go I will follow; but who will lead us?"</p>

<p>"I will lead one party, and my son here another. Come thou with
me, Khan, and send thy son with mine," replied the chief promptly.</p>

<p>"Where are we to go?" asked Fazil.</p>

<p>"We cannot say till we are on the road," said the chief, smiling.
"'Thieves,' they say, 'have longer ears than asses.' I have one of
my trumpeters here; and when it is time to move, a shrill blast will
be blown: till then, eat and make your preparations, as I will mine;"
and saluting them, Pahar Singh and his son walked to their horses,
and, mounting them, rode away.</p>

<p>"And do we go with them alone, father?" asked Fazil, following
the chief with his eyes, and in a tone of apprehension.</p>

<p>"No," said the Khan, "the order I gave for the Paigah and the
Abyssinian horse to march to-night to Sholapoor is for this service,
and we shall lead them."</p>

<p>"Excellent," cried Fazil joyfully; "then I fear nothing; but who
is this Pahar Singh? Surely I have seen him before."</p>

<p>"Certainly, in the Durbar at Nuldroog, when the deed of confirmation
was given to him."</p>

<p>"I was not there, father: I heard of it."</p>

<p>"Ah, true! Well, then, dost thou remember the Kullunder
Fakeer of the King's Durbar?"</p>

<p>"Protection of God!" cried Fazil; "ay, and the Jogi of the temple.
Strange, I thought I had seen those eagle eyes somewhere. I had
not forgotten them. Now, father, I will go with him; but tell him not
that I was at the temple. He might resent the death of his follower,
and recede from us."</p>

<p>"An excellent caution, son; no, he shall never know it."</p>

<p>"What are the Abyssinians getting ready for?" asked the Peer,
who came up at that moment. "Some secret service at Sholapoor, as
Ibrahim Khan tells me? There is no mutiny, no disaffection, Khan?"</p>

<p>"It is a secret service, my friend," replied Afzool Khan, smiling,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
"and Fazil and I are going with them; but there is no mutiny, or
cause for any, and we do not go to Sholapoor."</p>

<p>"Where, then?" cried the Peer. "Let me come; nay, I will take
no denial: whither thou goest I will follow."</p>

<p>"It were better not, Huzrut," replied the Khan; "it will be a
rough ride, and perhaps some rough work at the end of it; nevertheless,
as thou wilt. Come, sirs, we had need to eat first. Come, Bismilla!"</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_LVI" id="CHAPTER_LVI">CHAPTER LVI.</a></h2>


<p>"A dark night, my lord," cried Pahar Singh, as the Khan and his
son, accompanied by the Peer, rode up to a large fire which, kindled
by dry thorns from the hedges, sent up a ruddy blaze high in the air
as some loose fodder was thrown on it, displaying the tall form of the
chief, as he stood there with his nephew and several others, "and ye
are welcome; and here are the rest, too," he continued, as the foremost
men of the body of cavalry crowded up, the strong light
revealing the dark faces of the Abyssinians and the noble horses on
which they were mounted. "Bismilla! as ye say, let us mount and
depart."</p>

<p>"I have not kept you longer than I could help," said the Khan,
"and the men are divided into bodies, as you directed, under their
own leaders. With me are some of my people, and the noble Ibrahim
Khan himself with his; and I will remain with you as you proposed.
The rest of my men go with my son."</p>

<p>"When we get near the place, Khan," said Pahar Singh, "I will
give directions. And now, beat the drum, Lukshmun, and do you
and Rama look after the guides&mdash;you know the road; go on, and
beat the drum occasionally to let us know where you are."</p>

<p>"I would it were daylight, father," said Fazil; "it will be no easy
matter guiding all those men in the dark."</p>

<p>"Fear not, my lord," cried Pahar Singh, "we shall see better
when we are away from those fires, which only blind us. The roads
are dry, and your Beejapoor horses don't fear stones. In three
hours or more we shall be near the place, then a rest, and some
arrangements; and after that you can give your own orders, and we,
your servants, can execute them. Come, sirs, we can strike into the
road at the end of the field by the trees."</p>

<p>"Shall we have no torch on this unsainted errand?" said the Peer,
rather peevishly.</p>

<p>"Huzrut," said Pahar Singh, "this is hardly work for a man of
God, and the roads are rough. No; we must manage with what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
light the sky gives us, for we have to deal with wary people, and
'twere a pity to take the Khan so long a night ride and show him no
sport. If you are afraid the road will be too rough, do not come:
but ride with the force to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Afraid!" cried the Peer contemptuously. "I, a servant of God,
afraid! Astagh-fur-oolla! If there is any work to do, thou shalt
see whether a priest cannot strike as hard a blow as a layman. The
Khan can bear me witness that wherever he goes I am ever beside
him."</p>

<p>"Pardon me," cried the chief, laughing, "I will doubt no longer.
I only fear that, in catching thieves, there may be less need for our
swords than for contrivance to outwit them."</p>

<p>"And may not we know how, father," cried Fazil, riding to his
father's side, as they reached the end of the field, "what this contrivance
is, and where we go?"</p>

<p>"To Tooljapoor, my lord," replied Pahar Singh in a low voice, not
so as to be heard by the Peer: "a nest of traitors is assembled there,
and we need to take them out of it. Keep together, now, I pray ye,
gentlemen: I must ride before all for a short distance, and will rejoin
ye by-and-by."</p>

<p>"Tooljapoor!" exclaimed the Peer, when Pahar Singh had disappeared,
"a nest of idols and thieves, indeed. The haunt of a devil
in the shape of an old woman, whom they all worship. I know her,
with her red eyes; and when I have seen the idolatrous Kaffirs bow
down before her by thousands, I have longed for the sword of our
lord the Prophet to be among them. 'Inshalla!' when&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Peace, Huzrut," said the Khan, in a soothing tone, interrupting
him. "I have promised that the temple and the idol come to no
harm, on condition of taking none who are there, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, well, Khan," returned the Peer impatiently. "I am not a
Roostum, to slay all the unbelievers myself, or to overturn that abode
of devils! Do as thou wilt, friend; do as thou wilt. I will not
strike till thou dost&mdash;till I hear thy war-cry; after that&mdash;'Futteh-i-Nubbee'
(Victory to the Prophet) say I!"</p>

<p>"Ameen!" said the Khan dryly, "but I trust there will be no
need of it. Come, Fazil, let us turn into the road and keep it, before
the main body comes up. Listen," continued the Khan, as they rode
on by an open pathway among the fields of tall corn. "His plan is
for the town to be surrounded above, and a ravine below to be
blocked up. He would give thee the latter work, son, as the people
will try to escape thence."</p>

<p>"By the Prophet, an excellent plan," said the priest,&mdash;"no better
could be devised. A few horsemen across the mouth of the glen
will catch all that come out of the temple like fish in a net. I know
the place well. No one could get up the sides of that glen at night,&mdash;no,
not one."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span></p>

<p>"I would rather go with thee, father," said the young man; "my
place is with thee; surely any one could manage below, and if there
be danger&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There will be no danger, son," he returned: "these people will
be caught in their own trap, worshipping their horrible idol, and
will be unarmed. I shall keep outside the gates, and watch for the
fugitives. Pahar Singh knows the men he wants, and will take his
own people and some of the Abyssinians inside. If needs be, we
can meet in the temple, but there must be no question in regard to
this arrangement, which even the Peer ratifies."</p>

<p>"Surely, my lord," said the priest, "it is the fittest in all respects;
and Pahar Singh, considering that he is an infidel and robber, seems
a man of some propriety of manner, and is doing our lord the King
good service."</p>

<p>"Dost thou remember the cry, 'Ulla dilâyâ to léonga!' and the
tall Kullunder who brought the Wuzeer's papers to the Durbar?"
asked the Khan; "that was Pahar Singh."</p>

<p>"Ulla dilâyâ to léonga!" exclaimed the priest. "Yes, I remember.
'Puna-i-Khóda!' (protection of God) was that he? Then the night
before there was the same cry in the fort as I left the King; could
that have been he also? I thought it might have been some drunken
Kullunder, as they said it was."</p>

<p>"The night before Khan Mahomed was killed?" cried the Khan
and Fazil in a breath.</p>

<p>"Yes; why do you ask?" returned the priest; "it was near
morning."</p>

<p>"It was curious enough," said the Khan carelessly, "but those
Kullunders are very early; they like to be on foot when the women
are grinding at their mills, to get a handful of flour."</p>

<p>"Yes, it was about that time," said the priest unsuspiciously, and
the conversation dropped.</p>

<p>It was almost impossible to reunite again; for the road, which
was pretty broad and free from stones at first, shrunk to a narrow
path, through corn-fields on each hand, and it was difficult for more
than two to ride abreast with comfort; and sometimes, indeed, that
even could not be managed. They passed several villages at irregular
intervals, and proceeded without check or halt. Pahar Singh, for the
most part, rode in front of his own troop; but returned occasionally
to the Khan and his son, who, being between the advanced guard
and the main body, were unimpeded by the crowding which elsewhere
unavoidably existed.</p>

<p>Whether it was that their eyes had become more accustomed to
the darkness, or that the gloom of the first part of the night had
relaxed in some respect, it hardly signified; for, without betraying
their presence at any distance, there was light enough to distinguish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
the path; and to follow, without much inconvenience, the men who
preceded them. These were, as we know, ignorant of their destination:
and most believed it might be Puraindah, or somewhere on the
western frontier, where disturbance had occurred.</p>

<p>Those in advance, however, halted at length; and the rushing
sound of the trampling of the heavy body of horse, which had continued
through the night like a dull hoarse roar behind, gradually
grew fainter as the mass of men collected and stood still. The Khan
and his son, with the Peer, were speculating as to whether that was
to be the place of divergence, when Pahar Singh and his nephew
rode up, and at once put an end to the doubt.</p>

<p>"We separate here," he said; "and this, Meah Sahib, is my son
who will lead you; you will find him true and intelligent. Do not
go to Sindphul," he added to Gopal Singh; "Lukshmun knows the
high-road to Rutunjun by Uljapoor, and that will take you close
under the pass between Sindphul and the town. Keep in the hollow
near the river, and when you hear our shouts above, turn into the
ravine, and get up as far as you can. We will give you time before
we ourselves move into the temple."</p>

<p>A few words of farewell, as father and son dismounting, embraced
each other; a commending of each other to God and the Prophet;
and Fazil and his father separated.</p>

<p>The ground on which they had halted was level, and covered with
thick corn-fields, which extended, almost unbroken on their left hand,
to the south; but on their right, small watercourses and ravines
rendered any passage between the road westward and the hills impossible.
Where they stood, the hills were low, and a passage or
gap in them to the right was pointed out by Pahar Singh as the
direction of the main body: in front, they appeared to grow higher,
and a bluff termination of one bay, which stood out a dark gloomy
mass against the sky, was pointed out by Pahar Singh to the Khan
as near the town, and a light which seemed at times to glow in the
air about its brow, as the illumination of the town and the temple.</p>

<p>Ibrahim Khan, and several other officers of minor rank, had now
joined the group, and in a few words Pahar Singh explained how
they were to act. One body would turn to the right close to the
town, and guard the roads towards Little Tooljapoor and Bóree;
another party would spread to the left, on the plain which led to the
top of the pass; the third, which would be commanded by Pahar
Singh and Ibrahim Khan, would enter the town and seize the temple
gate, where there could be no egress for any one except through it,
or the postern below. Up the precipices of the glen, and over the
high walls of the temple, escape was impossible.</p>

<p>"Come, sirs," said Pahar Singh, after a delay which, to the Khan,
appeared intolerably long; "they are now near enough: follow me;"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
and, turning his horse up the pass, the men, taking the direction
from those in advance, moved after them as fast as the stony nature
of the ascent would allow.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It had been a rare night of enjoyment to the crowds assembled in
the temple, and attracted by the unusual amount of entertainment, the
town itself was nearly deserted by its Hindu inhabitants, who&mdash;men,
women, and children of all ranks, classes, and ages&mdash;had betaken
themselves to the lower court, which was as full as it could well be
packed: the people sitting in rows, as we have described on a
previous occasion, on the ground, or perched upon terraces, the
roofs of houses, and upon that of the vestibule.</p>

<p>As the night wore on, and the assembly seemed in no humour to
separate, Anunda, foreseeing the confusion which would arise when
the ceremonies should conclude with the last procession, had proposed
to Tara, as she joined them for a while in their accustomed
seat on the roof of the vestibule, to retire before the crush began;
but Tara herself was in the highest spirits: she had no fear of Moro
Trimmul; he had not so much as saluted her or seemed to notice
her. Gunga and the other priestesses had exhibited a flattering
deference, assisted her to bring garlands, and danced before her, as
the processions passed round the shrine, singling her out as their
object of respect&mdash;almost of adoration.</p>

<p>Few who had noticed Tara that night&mdash;and who did not?&mdash;ever
forgot the triumphant looks and gestures of the seemingly inspired
girl as she moved lightly and gracefully before the priests; or the
sweet, thrilling voice, which seemed to rise high above the rest in
the solemn hymns and chants of the ceremony. She felt secure in
the protection of her father, and even of the other girls, who had
besought her to stay till all was concluded; and the last service,
more solemn and more meritorious than the preceding, would be at
the sacred hour of the moon's change.</p>

<p>"Do thou and Radha go," she said; "it will be well. I cannot
leave anything unfinished, else the Mother will be angry, and I shall
regret it. I will stay near the shrine, and return with my father."</p>

<p>Anunda did not object, and she and Radha, congratulating themselves
upon having left early enough to escape inconvenience, gained
the gate of the temple unobserved, and made their way through the
deserted streets without interruption. There was no one in the house;
all the women-servants were absent at the ceremony. The watchman
who guarded the outer door of the house&mdash;one of the hereditary
Ramoosees of the town&mdash;sat with two of his men in the porch,
and, when the women came in, asked leave to go and see the last
procession, which was readily granted; so they were left alone: but
without apprehension.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span></p>

<p>From the terraced roof they looked out for some time, for the
brilliant illumination lighted up the temple spires, and from the large
oil-cressets a heavy smoke arose, which, floating above the temple
and its glen, caught the glare below, and ascended high into the air;
and so still was the town, that the measured cadence of the recitation
could be heard, though not the words; while occasionally a burst of
music or solemn hymn suddenly broke the silence, which was otherwise
oppressive.</p>

<p>Radha heard her brother's voice when his turn came, and listening
to it, wept silently. When should she see him again?&mdash;would absence
cure the madness that now possessed him?</p>

<p>"Weep not, child," said Anunda, throwing her arm around her,
and guessing her thoughts; "it is well he goes. When he departs,
thou wilt trust us the more, and be dearer unto us."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_LVII" id="CHAPTER_LVII">CHAPTER LVII.</a></h2>


<p>Meanwhile the rites proceeded, and the recitations. Moro Trimmul
was declaiming, with unusually excited gestures and eloquence, the
impassioned passages which had been assigned to him, often interrupted
by the cries of "Jey Kalee! Jey Toolja!" and the clapping of
hands which proceeded from the people whenever a favourite sentiment
or allusion to the glorious days of Hindu power occurred in the
text. Before concluding his part, which was the last of the night's
performance, he had withdrawn to the back of the temple, and
beckoned to Gunga, and a brief colloquy passed between them.</p>

<p>There was no faltering in the purposes of either. Gunga had
noticed the departure of Anunda and Radha with exultation which
she could hardly conceal. She had gone to Tara after she resumed
her position at the shrine, touched her feet, and thanked her for
remaining. Other priestesses, too, had crowded round her, and,
excited as they were, all united in determining that the last procession
should be unusually remarkable.</p>

<p>"See," said Gunga, as she came to him, "all is ready. There is
no one by the door inside; but try it, and ascertain who are outside.
Be thou ready only, and trust to me for the rest. Nay, I will come
with thee&mdash;look!"</p>

<p>The place was dark, for there was no illumination behind the
temple, and by its mass a broad shadow was thrown on the recess in
which the door was situated. The girl stepped into it, followed by
the Brahmun, and opened the door slightly. A number of dark
forms were sitting without on a small terrace, from whence descended
a flight of steps into the ravine. One rose. "Wagya!" she said in
a low voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am here, lady," he replied; "is it time?"</p>

<p>"Not yet. When the next procession passes round the corner
yonder, come out to look at it; you will not be noticed. Have you
the blanket?"</p>

<p>"It is here," he said, holding one up; "and they are all ready
yonder," and he pointed to the trees, where there was a dull glow as
of the embers of a small fire&mdash;"palankeen, horses and all."</p>

<p>"Be careful of her as you carry her out," she continued. "If she
is hurt&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The man laughed. "There is no fear," he said; "she will be
carried daintily like a child, and cannot struggle in this."</p>

<p>"Good," she replied; "now be careful, and watch."</p>

<p>"Art thou satisfied?" she continued to Moro Trimmul, who had
remained behind the door.</p>

<p>"Yes; thou art true, Gunga. I am true also, and here is the zone;
put it on, and let it shame hers," he replied, taking the ornament
from underneath his waist-cloth where he had concealed it.</p>

<p>"Ah!" she cried, taking it and clasping it round her waist, "thou
art&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What is that?" he cried, interrupting her and catching her arm;
"there is some disturbance without. What can it be? Listen!"</p>

<p>"I will look," she said; "stay thou here."</p>

<p>She turned the corner of the temple, but could proceed no farther.
Every one had risen: and there was a wild, struggling, heaving mass
of people before her, from among which piercing shrieks of women
and children, mingled with hoarse cries of men, were rising fast in a
dreadful clamour: while several shots, discharged in quick succession
at the gate above, seemed to add to the general terror and confusion.</p>

<p>"They are fighting at the gate!" cried a man near her; and a cry
of "the Toorks, the Toorks!" followed in agonizing tones from the
women.</p>

<p>Gunga did not hesitate. She, perhaps, of all that crowd, was the
most collected. Darting to Moro Trimmul she said hastily, "Do not
move&mdash;I will bring her;" and so passed round to the back of the
temple. As she did so, she met Tara and several other girls, some
screaming, others silent from terror, but evidently making for the
postern.</p>

<p>"My father! O Gunga, my father!" cried Tara piteously, "come
with me, we will find him. Come; I have none but thee, Gunga,
who dare seek him; come with me!"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, "round this way; I saw him a moment ago.
Come, we will get down the steps; I know the way up the mountain
from below. Come!" cried Gunga with a shriek; and seeing that
Tara hesitated, and that people were crowding through the vestibule
into the dark portion of the court, and hiding themselves among the
cloisters,&mdash;she caught her arm and dragged her forward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span></p>

<p>Moro Trimmul saw the action, and, unnoticed in the confusion,
seized Tara from behind and bore her to the postern. The girl's
shrieks seemed to ring high above all others in that horrible tumult,
but they were quickly stifled in the blanket thrown over her, while
she was borne rapidly down the steps by those stationed there, to
whom Moro Trimmul resigned her.</p>

<p>"Thou canst not return, Moro," said Gunga, who had closed and
locked the door unobserved and flung away the key; "let us fly for
our lives. Hark! they are fighting within, and may follow us."</p>

<p>"O for my sword to strike in once for those poor friends!" cried
Moro Trimmul with a groan. "They have been seeking me, and the
rest will suffer. What art thou but liar and murderess, O Toolja!
that thou dost not protect thy votaries? must they perish in thy
very presence?"</p>

<p>"Hush, and come fast," cried Gunga, dragging him down the steps.
"Fool, wilt thou die with the rest? Away! mount and ride for thy
life; I will bring her after thee."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Khan and his companions, as they had arranged, separated
into three bodies as they reached the town; and as they filed off to
the right and left in succession, the Khan, with the Peer and others,
rode into the gate, and secured it. They had met no one outside the
town; inside were a few of the royal soldiery on duty, who, themselves
surprised, could have made no opposition, even had the Khan
been an enemy.</p>

<p>Down the centre street, which was also empty, except of stragglers
coming from the temple, the horsemen poured, now pressing on fast
from the rear; and a body of them, dismounting in the centre of the
town, rushed forward down the bazar to secure the entrance to the
temple. Then some people, who were advancing, saw danger, and
hastened to warn those in charge to shut it, turning back with loud
shouts, others coming on. A party of the Nimbalkur's men, who
were in attendance with their chief's horses, and were around the
entrance within, mounted the small bastions at the sides, while others
shut the doors.</p>

<p>Those who reached them first were Pahar Singh and Ibrahim Khan,
with some of the Abyssinians and other followers, mingled together,
each striving to be foremost.</p>

<p>"Open the gate; we mean no harm," cried Pahar Singh in Mahratta;
"we are on the King's service, and if you resist, your blood
be on your own heads!"</p>

<p>"We will admit no one," cried a voice from the bastion. "Go!
ye are robbers, and we will fire on ye."</p>

<p>"I say it again," returned the chief, "we are a thousand men, and
I cannot save you if you hesitate. Open the gate!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span></p>

<p>There was no reply, but several matchlocks were pointed from the
parapet above, which was loopholed.</p>

<p>"Hast thou the axe, Rama?" asked the chief.</p>

<p>"It is here," said the man, drawing a heavy axe-head from his
waist: and, coolly fitting a helve to it, lifted it above his head.
"Shall I?"</p>

<p>"Strike!" cried Pahar Singh.</p>

<p>Several heavy blows fell on the gate, and a man called out from the
bastion, "Desist, or we fire."</p>

<p>But Rama heeded no warning. Again two crashing blows, struck
with his full force, had splintered some of the wood-work, and he
had uplifted his arm for another, when one of the men at a lower
loophole fired. Rama swayed to and fro for a moment, and, falling
heavily to the ground, the blood gushed from his mouth in a torrent.</p>

<p>Pahar Singh did not speak, but he gnashed his teeth in fury.
Rama, of all his inferior followers, was the one most devoted&mdash;and
was brave to recklessness. The chief saw that the shot must have
been deadly. He might have shared the same fate; but the men
without, his own as well as the Abyssinians, returned the fire, and
distracted the aim of those within.</p>

<p>"By&mdash;&mdash;" and the oath was lost in the clamour&mdash;he cried, putting
his sword between his teeth, seizing the axe, and striking at the door
with his whole force, "ye shall die, sons of vile Mahratta mothers.
Every one of ye shall howl in hell for that poor fellow."</p>

<p>Blow after blow followed; and as the panel near the lock broke
under them, a number of the chief's men and the Abyssinians rushed
against the door, which gave way under their combined weight and
force, and entrance was effected.</p>

<p>On the noise of the first shouts reaching them, the Khan, the priest,
and others, rushed down the street, and arrived at the scene of action.
The firing was increasing, and several of the Khan's followers and
Abyssinians had fallen. Some were already dead, others wounded;
and, wedged as they had been in a mass, every shot had told on them,
while those who defended the gate could not be seen. Its being forced,
however, changed the feature of the contest; and the Khan, who, in
the heat of the excitement, forgot his caution and warning to the men,
now shouted his battle-cry; while the priest, struggling in with the
rest, cried to the men&mdash;"Bismilla!&mdash;in the name of God and the
Prophet&mdash;slay, slay&mdash;ye true believers! Heed not death&mdash;ye will be
martyrs! Let not the Kaffirs live, who have killed the faithful. Send
them to hell, to perish with their devil's idols. Kill! kill!"</p>

<p>With such cries, had men of Islam been hounded on by their priests
before. Was he to be less? Here, in the very holiest of infidel
temples, should the might of Islam be felt.</p>

<p>But, in truth, the men needed but little excitement; what was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
there before them was enough. Who did not remember that it was
a Jéhâd, a war of the faith, which had been preached to them daily?
Who did not remember that to slay infidels in war earned the blessing
of the Prophet and paradise? So, with Pahar Singh leading them,
his sword between his teeth, and striking down men right and left
with every blow of his axe, the infuriated soldiery rushed in a body
down the steps and into the large court below.</p>

<p>Who can describe the scene? Shrieking women and helpless men
strove to fly before them, but in vain; and the bloody work of their
enemies, as they pressed forward, hewing with their long sharp
weapons at the unresisting masses, was quick and deadly. Pahar
Singh saw Nimbalkur and several other chiefs standing resolutely
before the entrance to the shrine, sword in hand, awaiting the onset.
"Yield," he cried, "your lives will be spared; why shed blood? Jey
Rao, be wise, down with your sword;"&mdash;and for an instant the parties
stood opposite to each other glaring defiance. But bloodshed was not
yet to be stayed. Some of the infuriated Abyssinians again dashed
into the mass of the people with a shout of "Deen, Deen!" striking
indiscriminately at all before them, and the Mahratta chiefs were
swept into the temple. As they were followed, Vyas Shastree, who,
remembering his old skill in weapons, and unable to control himself,
had seized sword and shield and mixed with the rest,&mdash;struck at a
huge negro who was foremost, and wounded him severely.</p>

<p>"Dog of a Kaffir," cried the man, grinding his teeth, "get thee to
hell!" and had not his arm caught that of a fellow-soldier who was
near, depriving the cut of its force, Vyas Shastree had spoken no
more. As it was, the blow descended upon his bare head,&mdash;he fell
senseless among the crowd of dead and dying,&mdash;and those who
entered the temple, trampled over him as one of the slain.</p>

<p>Pahar Singh's object was to save the shrine if possible, but he felt
himself helpless against the crowd of Moslems who, headed by the
priest, now filled the vestibule, shouting their fanatic cry of "Deen,
Deen!" Life was dear to him, dearer than the idol, for which, in
truth, he had no particular veneration, though he had dread. "If
thou canst not save thyself, Mother," he muttered, "I am not going
to die for thee," and, stepping aside, the men of Islam pressed on.</p>

<p>The priest was among the foremost to enter the sanctum, where
two old Brahmuns, cowering beside the altar, were instantly slain;
and, seizing the necklaces of pearls and precious stones, he tore them
away from the neck of the image, with one hand flinging them out
among the people, while with the other he overthrew it, and, trampling
it underfoot, spat upon the face in scorn and contempt.</p>

<p>If the men in the temple courts, impelled by religious fury,
showed no mercy, and, hunting unresisting men and women into dark
corners, slew them indiscriminately till the areas were filled with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
dead and dying, lying in heaps as they had fallen by the sword or
had been trampled down; those who had remained outside were, in
their turn, no more humane. Under the cry of "Deen, Deen!&mdash;for
the faith, for the faith!" more cruelty was perpetrated in Tooljapoor
than it has ever since forgotten; and daylight revealed a scene of
plunder, rapine, and destruction, such as may be conceived&mdash;but
hardly described.</p>

<p>Anunda and Radha were safe at home, as we have already related;
when, after an indistinct murmur, for which she could not account,
the shots at the temple gate were suddenly heard; and, looking from
the terrace, they saw the confusion in the court commence. Both
were brave, but the terror of Anunda for her husband and Tara, was
fast paralysing her senses.</p>

<p>"I will die here," she said; "take the wealth and jewels and leave
me. Escape as thou canst, Radha; hide thyself, Moro will come and
seek thee."</p>

<p>But Radha would not leave her; and, descending to the lower
apartments, they sat cowering in their chamber, shivering at every
sound, and, having extinguished the light, remained in utter
darkness.</p>

<p>"Lady, lady!" cried a man's voice in the outer verandah; "where
art thou?"</p>

<p>"It is Jánoo Näik, the Ramoosee," said Anunda in a whisper.
"God reward him for coming; he is true; Radha, let us go with
him."</p>

<p>"Lady, lady! the house is not safe! come, come," continued the
man earnestly; "leave all&mdash;my people will guard it&mdash;only come.
Your honour is more than wealth, and you can only save it by flight."</p>

<p>The terror of violence brought them forth. "Follow me," he said;
"here are twenty men to guard the house&mdash;no one will molest them."</p>

<p>The women followed silently, sobbing as they went. The Ramoosee
led them northwards out of the town to the edge of the great
ravine, and descended a steep path, which they knew led to a spring
in one of the broad steps or ledges of the mountain, near which was
a recess in the rock familiar to both. "Stay here," he said; "no one
can see you. I must return: here, I should only betray you."</p>

<p>"At least, take away our ornaments," said Anunda; "we dare not
keep them. Keep them thyself, or hide them somewhere;" and the
women hastily took off all they wore, and laid them on the ground
before him.</p>

<p>Jánoo sat down on his hams, and counted them deliberately.
"There are thirteen pieces, large and small, gold and silver together.
Yes, they are safe with me. Now, take my blanket, though it be a
Mang's; sit in it till daylight. Ye can bathe afterwards and be
clean. I will come early if I can, and take ye down the hills to
Afsinga, or else send my son."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span></p>

<p>So saying, and without waiting for a reply, he left them, ascended
the path rapidly, and disappeared over the ledge of the mountain;
and the women remained, shivering with fright and cold, and listening
in terror to the shots, which rose above the confused roar of
screams and shouts proceeding from the town.</p>

<p>On the other side, in the ravine, the progress of the band who
carried off Tara was but a short one. Struggling vainly with her
captors, she found resistance hopeless. Borne in the arms of two
men, others held her hands and feet; and over her one of the thick
coarse blankets of the common people had been thrown, which
prevented cry of any kind. Tara felt that the men were gentle with
her, and in spite of her terror, she retained her senses completely.
She was aware that she was taken down the steps, and hurried along
rapidly at a run; then there was a pause, and she was thrown into&mdash;rather
than placed in&mdash;a palankeen, the doors shut to violently, and
kept closed. They were carrying her away. Who could it be but
Moro Trimmul, that was to leave that night? Even now her father
might hear her screams, and terror lent strength to her voice; but in
vain&mdash;succour from him was indeed hopeless.</p>

<p>As may be supposed, nothing had prevented the progress of the
party under Fazil and Gopal Singh; and the latter, a pleasant companion,
had amused the young Khan with anecdotes of his uncle, and
of their border life. He knew the ground perfectly, and they soon
reached their destination; and while part of his men were drawn up
between the rivulet and the pass, and some even ascended the pass
itself, he conducted Fazil into the temple glen, which turned to the
right out of the main ravine. At its mouth was some level ground,
and the horsemen had just occupied it when the attack began above.</p>

<p>It would have been impossible for the bearers of Tara's litter to
carry it over that rough path in the dark; and as she had been put
into it, a torch was lighted, which was instantly seen by Fazil and
Gopal Singh.</p>

<p>"Not a word from any one," cried the latter; "some one is escaping.
They cannot get away from us. Now, Meah, be careful."</p>

<p>"Strike, if any one resists," said Fazil to the men about him; "but
it is better to take them alive. Look, 'tis a litter&mdash;who can it be?
Peace, all of you; be silent!"</p>

<p>The gloom of night and some bushes concealed them, and the
advancing party saw and suspected nothing. Moro Trimmul was
riding in front, Gunga following him. The palankeen was behind
with the Ramoosees and servants around it on all sides. The
baggage-ponies had already gone on before.</p>

<p>"Stop!" cried Fazil, as he laid hold of the Brahmun, and held his
naked sword over him. "Who art thou?&mdash;nay, struggle or attempt
to escape, and I will kill thee.&mdash;A Brahmun? Who art thou?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span></p>

<p>Moro Pundit had had no time to dress himself for the journey.
His clothes were in the palankeen. Naked to the waist, with his hair
streaming about his shoulders, he had come as he had been reciting.
He had no weapons, nor means of resistance; and, though a powerful
man, was no match for Fazil, who held him like a vice.</p>

<p>"Moro Trimmul, by the gods!" exclaimed Gopal Singh, who
recognized him as the light from the torch fell upon him. "Ah,
Maharaj!" he added, "you don't know me, but I have seen you
before."</p>

<p>"Then we are indeed fortunate, friends," said Fazil joyfully; "and
who is in the litter?"</p>

<p>"My wife," said the Brahmun sullenly; "do as ye will with me,
but let her and the servants go on."</p>

<p>"Then thou hast married only lately, Pundit?" said Gopal Singh
dryly; "thou hadst no wife three days ago. We had as well look at
her, at all events, Meah, and prevent her screaming."</p>

<p>"Open the door! release me! release me!" cried Tara from within
in piteous accents. "Let me go! let me go! Ah, sirs, for your
mothers' honour, release me!"</p>

<p>"Art thou his wife?" asked Fazil, dismounting and opening the
door of the palankeen; "if so, fear not, we have no war with
women."</p>

<p>"Not so; I am not his wife," cried Tara hastily, disengaging herself
from the litter, and throwing herself at Fazil's feet. "O sir, save
me! Noble sir, by your mother's, by your sister's honour, save me
from him; he would have carried me away. Nay, I will not rise till
you tell me you will take me to my father. O return with me and
rescue him, else he will be slain! Come, I will lead ye back; he is
a priest of the temple!"</p>

<p>"It cannot be, girl," said Fazil, more disturbed by Tara's beauty,
and more agitated than he cared to acknowledge to himself. "It
cannot be till daylight, and no one will touch your father if he be a
Brahmun; so sit in the litter and fear not. And thou art not his
wife?" and he pointed to Moro Trimmul.</p>

<p>"O no, my lord," said the girl trembling; "you have been sent by
the Holy Mother to deliver me, else he would have carried me away
by force. Do not give me to him, I beseech you."</p>

<p>"Fear not," said Fazil; "no harm shall come to thee here. There
is more in this matter than we can now find out, friends," he continued
to those about him; "but bind that Brahmun on his horse,
and tie it to one of your own."</p>

<p>"Ah, sir, I will do that beautifully," cried Lukshmun, "and with
his own waist-cloth too. But, friends, see that my wife does not run
away, while I am busy for the master there&mdash;to my mind she is the
handsomest of the two."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span></p>

<p>It was Gunga who, knowing the path, had turned from it when
Moro Trimmul met Fazil, and, slipping from her horse, had tried to
escape among the bushes; but the quick eye of Lukshmun had detected
her, and he had seized and dragged her forward.</p>

<p>"May earth fall on thee, dog!" cried the girl, struggling with
him, "foul hunchback as thou art, let me go."</p>

<p>"Not so," he said, "I know thee, Gunga. My lord, she is one
of the Moorlees of the Mother up yonder; and are not all women
taken in war slaves?"</p>

<p>"Peace," cried Fazil; "sit quiet there, girl; move not, else I will
have thee tied. Ah, that will do, friend," he continued, as Lukshmun
finished his careful binding up of Moro Trimmul; "you have not
hurt him?"</p>

<p>"Master," replied the man, wagging his head, "it is a plan of my
own, and while he is helpless to move, he is in no pain. Is it not so,
Maharaj? Now sit quiet on your horse, Punditjee, while I look
after my wife; she has a noble gold belt, which she has promised
me. Is it not so, O lotos-face?"</p>

<p>"My lord," said Gopal Singh, interrupting, "the disturbance above
grows worse&mdash;had we not as well send the women and others to the
rear? If there is any rush this way, they may come to harm."</p>

<p>"A good thought, friend," replied Fazil.</p>

<p>"It is no use," said Gunga, "the door is locked, and the key was
thrown away: no one can escape from thence by this road."</p>

<p>So they remained, while the tumult increased to a roar which
filled the glen, above which shots were now and then heard; then
fell to a dull murmur, and finally seemed to die away in the distant
town. The temple lights became dim, and went out one by one,
and the ravine grew dark. Then the stars shone out, and after a
while dawn broke, and the mountain, and the rugged precipices of
the glen and town above, were gradually revealed in the grey light.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_LVIII" id="CHAPTER_LVIII">CHAPTER LVIII.</a></h2>


<p>A weary delay and suspense had been endured till the day broke.
Tara had been told, in kind and respectful tones, by the young Khan,
whose protection she had claimed, to rest in the palankeen, and he
had considerately shut the door to prevent annoyance to her by his
men. So she sat undisturbed, but listening to the fearful din from
the town and temple, shuddering at every cry and shriek; and when
all was at last silent, speculating upon the probable fate of her
father, and of her mother and Radha, in a dreamy uncertainty,
mingled with extreme terror.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span></p>

<p>What had happened? That the town had been surrounded by
the King's troops there could be no doubt; yet why the violence?
Who could the young leader of the party be, by whom she had been
arrested, who spoke her own Mahratta tongue so softly and so
well? A strange thing, for he was evidently a Mussulman of rank.
He had looked so grand and beautiful as the torchlight flashed upon
his bright steel morion and silvery coat of mail. She had never seen
aught like him before. He might resemble the god Rámchunder,
she thought, when he went to battle with the demon Rawun; and
she shut her eyes at a vision at once so beautiful and so terrible.
Her gentle mind was all confusion, mingled with dreadful and undefined
anticipation of misery; yet one thing was clear, she had been
saved by that noble youth from Moro Trimmul and Gunga's united
design&mdash;saved from worse than death.</p>

<p>The torch carried with her palankeen had been extinguished in
the surprise, but the torch-bearer had been detained, and she could
see him sitting near the litter pouring a drop or two of oil upon it
now and then to keep it alight, yet without flaring. Once it did
blaze up, and revealed for an instant the faces of the bearers sitting
on their hams in a group, and the horsemen with Fazil in his bright
armour standing around them; but all were strangers, else she would
have spoken again&mdash;anything to divert her brooding thoughts and
misery.</p>

<p>As the grey light of dawn increased she could see, through the
small Venetian blinds of the litter, that the royal horsemen stood in
groups at a short distance, all with their swords drawn. One party
watched Moro Trimmul, who, tightly swathed in a cotton sheet so
that he could not use his arms, sat upon his horse, which was tied to
another. Gradually she could see his features, gloomy and stern;
savage, indeed, as he writhed in the bandage which he was powerless
to remove. Near him, on a strong pony, sat the girl Gunga, covered
with a coarse white sheet, which had been thrown over her. A
short stout man was holding her pony's head, and his own horse
stood beside her. Around were the soldiers, all mounted, and apart
from them their young leader, on a powerful white horse, which
stood still, tossing its head, and champing its bit occasionally.</p>

<p>Past this figure, upon which her eyes rested wonderingly, as the
growing daylight revealed it more fully, she looked up to the glen,
and temple, and town, where all was still&mdash;a silence she thought like
death. The usual sounds of waking life, the music at the temple,
which always played as daylight broke, the earliest morning hymns,
and clash of cymbals, were all wanting. They were at the mouth of
the glen in a small paddock, near an old temple; she knew the place
perfectly, and many a time had wandered there with her mother, or,
with other girls, in search of flowers, and pieces of frankincense from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
the ancient trees which grew among some ruined walls. If the
service in the temple had not been interrupted, it would have been
proceeding at this hour, and the sound would come clearly to the
place where they were; but the stillness was not broken. The men
about her occasionally conversed in low tones or in whispers, but
were for the most part silent.</p>

<p>It was now light enough to move, and the young Khan, calling
to the bearers, bade them take up the litter and proceed. They
were about to do so, when Tara again renewed her piteous appeal
to him.</p>

<p>"O do not take me away!" she cried, "O release me! I can find
my way up the mountain. My father was in the temple; my mother
and all my people look for me. O noble sir, what am I to you? let
me go; by your honour, do not deceive me!"</p>

<p>"Not so, lady," said Fazil, stooping from his horse towards the
litter. "It is not fit for thee to go alone after last night's disturbance;
and there are rough folk up yonder, for whom I will not
answer with one so fair as thou art. No one ever relied in my
honour that was deceived. Still trust, lady, and I will see thee safe
amongst thy people; fear not."</p>

<p>"O noble sir," said Tara sobbing, "I do trust, I will trust; but
O, give me not to him yonder, who is bound. He would have carried
me away, and dishonoured me. O sir, you have been my preserver
from this danger, and I kiss your feet. My father is Vyas Shastree,
the chief priest of the temple, and we are well known. Take me to
him, or send for him, and he and my mother will bless you. O noble
sir, deceive not a helpless girl!"</p>

<p>"Vyas Shastree!" cried Gopal Singh, who had overheard the
latter part of Tara's passionate appeal; "then this, Meah Sahib, is
his daughter Tara, the strange new Moorlee; so beautiful that they
say she bewitches all men who see her. Art thou not she, O girl?
art thou not Tara, the Moorlee? Speak truly."</p>

<p>"I am Tara," she replied, "but no Moorlee. I serve only in the
temple."</p>

<p>"It is a lie," cried Gunga sharply; "she is a Moorlee, and one of
us; do not believe her. Was she not dancing in the temple when
the disturbance began? He carry her off, Meah Sahib?" she cried
to Fazil Khan, pointing to Moro Trimmul. "I tell you we had all
arranged to go together, and because she is more dainty than I am,
he got a palankeen for her."</p>

<p>"Peace, girl," cried Fazil; "be not shameless."</p>

<p>"O noble sir," exclaimed Tara, interrupting him, "heed her not;
what matter what she says? only take me to my father, then you
will know the truth. Indeed, indeed, I am no Moorlee like her; and
forgive me for saying so much, but you are kind, and so I speak."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span></p>

<p>"Who is this girl?" said Fazil sternly to Moro Trimmul. "What
art thou doing with her? Is she Vyas Shastree's daughter?"</p>

<p>"I give no answer; find out for yourself. Why do you ask of
me?" replied Moro Trimmul sullenly. "Cut me to pieces, but you
get no speech from me."</p>

<p>"It is no use, Meah, asking him," said Gopal Singh; "let us take
her up into the town, and see after her people."</p>

<p>"Not yet," returned Fazil. "My father will most likely encamp at
that village yonder, among the trees. Let these persons remain here,
and we will go and see what they have been doing in the town. Stay
thou here, Shêre Khan, with the men. See that no one disturbs
this girl; keep the others apart, and wait for us by the trees yonder.
Fear not," he continued to Tara; "I will bring news of thy people;
keep close within the palankeen, and no one can harm thee;" and so
saying, he turned his horse in the direction of the pass.</p>

<p>"Fear not, lady," said Shêre Khan, a fine old soldier; "he will be
as good as his word. Ay, look after him; the bravest, gentlest,
most faithful master that ever men served under. Yes, trust to his
honour; he will not deceive thee, he is too brave and too innocent
for that."</p>

<p>For the time it was a sweet assurance to Tara, and one utterly
unexpected; for Mussulmans&mdash;or Toorks, as the Mahrattas called them&mdash;had
hitherto been terrible people in her imagination; but the dread
for her father lying at her heart had as yet no relief, and her suspense
and terror continued.</p>

<p>Leaving Tara with his party below, Fazil Khan, with Gopal Singh,
and others, rode up the pass, as soon as the rugged path could be
safely traversed. What had happened in the temple? It was clear
there had been some fighting&mdash;that Fazil had expected from the Mahratta
chiefs; they would hardly be taken without resistance, and there
was an undefined dread lying at his heart, that if the fanatical spirit
of the men had been aroused by the Peer, some evil might have been
done to the Hindu people or to the temple. Again and again he
regretted that that holy person had not been sent on to Sholapoor with
the main body of the force, and blamed himself for not having foreseen
mischief.</p>

<p>Fazil Khan by no means shared the grim detestation of Hindus as
infidels, in which his father gloried; and he had been no willing
listener to the denunciations poured out against them by the Peer
and other preachers, in the sermons on the Jéhâd or religious war,
which had been preached at the capital and in camp. True, his
father and the Peer, as well as others, resented the mingling, under
the green banner of the faith, of Mahratta infidels with Moslems;
but Fazil knew them to be good and true soldiers; and his friendship
for Bulwunt Rao, and experience of his devotion, had changed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
the young Khan's feelings very materially. Perhaps, also, Bulwunt
Rao's character had, in some respects, softened the Khan's dislike of
"infidels," "Kaffirs," as he called them; but on occasions, the old
fanatical spirit would break through all restraint, and urge him to
deeds for which he had but little remorse. Too justly, therefore, Fazil
feared this might have been such an occasion.</p>

<p>They gained the summit of the pass as the sun's rays, rising
through lines of cloud which hung over the eastern horizon, spread
like a rosy fan into the blue and yellow sky above, tinging the lower
lines of cloud with tints of scarlet and gold, against which the dark
purple masses of mountain stretching into the plain stood out in bold
relief. About the space between the town and the edge of the mountain,
some of the Abyssinian horsemen were distributed in groups;
while further on were other bodies of men, some mounted, others
leading their horses up and down. The Nagarchees, or kettle-drummers
of each body, were beating the assembly vigorously, and
single men were rapidly arriving from other quarters and joining
their divisions. Fazil rode on with his companions, looking for somebody
he knew, who might give him news of his father, when, from
behind a mass of buildings which formed the corner of a street outside
the town gate, a cavalcade approached, led by men of his own
Paigah, and in the midst of which rode his father, the Peer, and
Ibrahim Khan, the leader of the Abyssinians, accompanied by the
tall, martial figure of Pahar Singh.</p>

<p>A hearty greeting ensued from all, and Fazil saw that his father
and the Peer were flushed with excitement, while in the severe
threatening aspect of Pahar Singh, there was an expression which he
could not define, which might be either habitual&mdash;the result of the
night's fatigue, or something more&mdash;perhaps grief.</p>

<p>"Come on, my son," cried the Khan cheerily; "we have ordered
up provisions for the men, and can rest here in the Gosai's Mutt, before
we ride on to Sholapoor, and get some kichéri cooked, which our
friend Ibrahim Khan has promised to see after. Inshalla! we sent
many a Kaffir to hell last night before his time," he continued, twisting
up his moustaches, "and Tooljapoor will long remember firing
upon Afzool Khan's men and killing true believers! but we did not
get that Brahmun of Sivaji's,&mdash;what was his name, Pahar Singh?&mdash;though
he was there when we came; and that was a pity. M&mdash;M&mdash;M&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Moro Trimmul," said Pahar Singh, interposing.</p>

<p>"Ay, that was it&mdash;thanks, friend; and what hast thou done, my
son?"</p>

<p>"I have taken him!&mdash;that Moro whom ye sought," returned Fazil,
"with two women and their servants."</p>

<p>"Now Alla be praised!" cried the Peer, "that he fell into thy
hands, Meah, for that crowns our work; and alive?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span></p>

<p>"Alive and unhurt, Huzrut."</p>

<p>"Are you sure it is he?" asked Pahar Singh. "There are as
many Moro Trimmuls as there are Tannajee Maloosrays!"</p>

<p>"Your nephew says it is. He, and a humpbacked servant or retainer
of yours, both knew him," returned Fazil.</p>

<p>"Yes, uncle," cried Gopal Singh, who now joined the group, "it
is the true man; but he is sullen, and will not speak. We have left
him below, safely bound; Lukshmun is watching him as a dog
watches a rat, and there are all the young Khan's men and ours with
him."</p>

<p>"Go, bring him up," said Afzool Khan; "let us examine him, and
take his statement."</p>

<p>"Good, my lord; my nephew will go for him, if a Hindu may be
trusted," said Pahar Singh, as Fazil thought, with a sneer.</p>

<p>"Certainly," replied the Khan, "let him be brought."</p>

<p>"And the women, Meah?" asked Gopal Singh.</p>

<p>"Not yet," he replied; "let the Brahmun come first;" and the
young man, turning his horse, galloped towards the pass.</p>

<p>"What women?" asked the Khan carelessly.</p>

<p>"Two who were with him," replied his son. "I will tell you of
them afterwards."</p>

<p>The house they were going to was only a few yards distant;
Ibrahim Khan rode on, saluting them as he passed, and they dismounted
and entered. "Embrace me, son," said the Khan, before
he seated himself, "and give thanks to God for the victory. Alla
has been merciful, and has&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, he has permitted his servants to do vengeance on the infidels,"
said the Peer, interrupting Afzool Khan; "the idols of Satan have
been overthrown, and their altar sprinkled with the blood of their
infidel priests."</p>

<p>"Protection of God!" cried Fazil; "the temple has not been
harmed, nor its people, I trust? We had no war against priests,
father."</p>

<p>"Not the temple, Meah&mdash;not the temple," returned the Peer,
rubbing his hands together complacently. "It would take a good
deal of gunpowder to blow it up, and we have none; but for the rest,
the work was well done. Inshalla! they will not be able to renew
their devil-worship; and when the King, on whom be peace, gives
permission, I&mdash;I, Peer Syud Bundagee&mdash;will come and destroy this
house of idols, and build a mosque upon it; and true believers will
be feasted with cow's flesh slain within its precincts. Ul-humd-ul-illa,
who hath given us the victory!"</p>

<p>"Father," said the young man gravely, "is it as he says?"</p>

<p>"Even so, my son, and thank God for it; and I have vowed to
give a thousand rupees to the work, in memory of the victory,"
replied Afzool Khan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span></p>

<p>Fazil turned away, sick at heart. What evil might not have been
done? more, even, than his fears had anticipated.</p>

<p>"And thou hast no congratulation for thy father, Fazil?" asked
the Khan, in a tone of disappointment.</p>

<p>"O father, a thousand that thou art safe through last night," cried
Fazil, "and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No rejoicing for victory over the infidels?" asked the priest, with
a sneer. "Thou hast a rare sympathy with them, I know, Meah
Sahib; is this seemly in a Mussulman?"</p>

<p>"Not with rebels, not with the King's enemies," returned Fazil
quickly; "but I never warred against priests and women yet, nor
did he. What hath been done, father?"</p>

<p>"Well, son," replied the Khan, "they would not let us in after
those Mahratta rebels, and Pahar Singh there broke down the door;
meanwhile some of our men had been shot, for they fired first, and
Huzrut there cried 'Deen, Deen!' and we all rushed in pell-mell and
cleared the court; that is all." He said this apologetically, Fazil
thought, and feared to tell the rest.</p>

<p>"Will you come with me, Pahar Singh?" said the young man;
"you know the place; I would see it."</p>

<p>"Yes, I will come," said the chief, rising, and sighing as he replied;
"perhaps it could not be helped, and yet some things were done
which will stir Hindu minds sorely throughout the country. Come,
Meah Sahib; it is not a pleasant sight, but I will go with you."</p>

<p>"Keep the prisoner till I return, father," continued Fazil; "I
would fain hear what he says for himself."</p>

<p>"If thou wilt go, son, return quickly," replied the Khan, "but I
had rather thou didst not. What is the use of it? what is done is
done;" and Fazil thought his father sighed.</p>

<p>"I would rather see the worst with my own eyes, father," replied
Fazil, "than hear lies from others. Come, sir," he added to Pahar
Singh, who waited for him, "I attend you."</p>

<p>"He will be vexed at what he finds," said the Khan when Fazil
was gone; "and it will distress his young heart. He has never seen
the like, and it requires older eyes, like thine and mine, Huzrut, to
look on such sights unmoved."</p>

<p>"Ay, true," replied the Peer; "but one or two battle-fields will be
enough to cure him, and methinks he is over-tender to infidels. Well,
we shall see what he advises about this Brahmun, for he is clear in
council. The man ought to die."</p>

<p>"He will not care about the men," said the Khan, musing abstractedly,
"but about the women who are dead; and that loving
heart of his mother's which she gave him, will be grieved. God
knows I would not have had it so."</p>

<p>"Ameen!" said the Peer, "nor I, Khan. But they were only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
Kaffirs after all, and did not Feroze Shah, of blessed memory, make a
pile of infidels' heads before the gate of Gulburgah fort?"</p>

<p>Afzool Khan did not answer&mdash;he appeared ill at ease: and the
priest, taking his beads from his waist-band, settled himself on his
heels, with his eyes shut, assuming an attitude of complacent meditation
on things divine, as they passed rapidly through his fingers.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_LIX" id="CHAPTER_LIX">CHAPTER LIX.</a></h2>


<p>Fazil and Pahar Singh went out together into the street. The latter
led the way through the gate and along the main streets of the town
to its centre, where a busy, motley scene now presented itself. The
Amil, or local civil officer, was seated in his Kuchéri, or hall of
audience, surrounded by a crowd of people to whom he was giving
orders for flour, grain, butter, sheep, forage, and the other countless
necessities of the force which had so suddenly come upon him. They
did not pause there, but turned down the main street leading to the
temple, the gilded spires and other portions of which appeared at the
end of it, the craggy sides of the glen, and, beyond all, the precipices
of the Ram Durra, which were veiled in the blue morning vapour.</p>

<p>Now there was no doubt of what had happened. The pavement
of the bazar, worn smooth by the naked feet of thousands of pilgrims
and devotees in centuries past, was stained with blood which, as they
advanced, was still wet and slippery in many places. Already had
the town scavengers begun to wash it away, and were pouring vessels
of water on the flags and sweeping them with brooms. A few shops
only were open for the sale of flour, butter, and groceries, the owners
of which sat within, with scared faces, evidently in the direst terror.</p>

<p>"They lay thick here," said Pahar Singh&mdash;the first words he had
spoken, "but have been removed, and they are burying them yonder,
outside, all together&mdash;infidels, as your father would say, and true believers.
But stay, Meah Sahib, there is one of my poor fellows lying
here in a shop. I thought him dead, but he is alive as yet; let us
look at him. A poor fellow," he said, repressing a sob; "a poor
hunchback, but he was like a dog to me&mdash;not a man. Perhaps he
may know me now, or he may be dead; let us see."</p>

<p>Pahar Singh turned to the right into a small courtyard, in an open
verandah of which several rough-looking men were sitting beside a
body laid on the ground, and partly covered with a bloody sheet.
They rose as the chief advanced, and saluted him.</p>

<p>"How is he now, Nursinga?" asked Pahar Singh; "will he live?
Rama," he continued, bending over the man, whose eyes were
evidently glazing fast, "Rama, dost thou know me&mdash;the master?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span></p>

<p>The man looked vacantly around, hearing the words, smiled, and
felt about with his hands, as if to clutch what it was denied him to
see. Suddenly, and as the chief put his own hand into that which
sought it, the dying eyes brightened, and met those of his master in
a scared, wild gaze at first, but one which softened tenderly into a
look of rapt affection. He tried to speak, but it was hopeless; to
raise himself by drawing his master's hand to him, and clasping that
he had in both his own&mdash;but in vain. The lips moved, and Pahar
Singh bent his head down to listen. The bystanders could hear
nothing; but Pahar Singh said in his ear loudly, "Yes, it shall all be
done&mdash;all; fear not."</p>

<p>It was enough. Perhaps the man might have lingered a while if
he had not been excited; but the old chief's words had suddenly
rallied the flickering lamp of life. It had sparkled for a moment,
and fell back, dull and smouldering, into the socket; the eyes again
glazed, and the clasped hands relaxed their grasp, tried once more to
recover it, failed, and fell powerless beside him, and the rugged
bronzed features were fast growing into the strange majesty of
Death.</p>

<p>"It is no use staying," said the chief, drawing away his hand to
brush the tears from his eyes, "he will not know me again. Come,
Meah; I, too, am growing a fool. See to him, all of you. If his
brother come, well and good; if not, bury him decently, and not with
the rest."</p>

<p>"Have you any retainer who is loved and trusted as you would
trust a faithful hound?" asked Pahar Singh, suddenly turning
round as they were walking out of the court. "Ah! I forget, dogs
are impure to you Mussulmans," he continued; "forgive me."</p>

<p>"Nay, no forgiveness is needed," replied Fazil. "Yes, I have one
as true and faithful to me as that poor fellow was to you."</p>

<p>"What is he?" asked the chief abruptly&mdash;"Mussulman or Hindu?"</p>

<p>"Hindu," replied Fazil; "a Mahratta."</p>

<p>"A Mahratta," cried the chief; "one of the enemies of your race?
I marvel, and yet am glad. Yes, be true to him and he will never
deceive you; he will give his life for you. Only be true, as I have
been to mine. Two in a month," he muttered to himself; "one there,
one here; my best and truest. What matter, Meah?" he continued
aloud; "sooner or later the message reaches us all. Mine might
have come last night, yet I am here."</p>

<p>Was this the old Jogi of the temple of Beejapoor? the sordid lover
of gold, the pitiless robber and murderer? A strange contradiction
in character as in acts; and now, sobbing as he walked out into the
street, Fazil could see that tears were wet on his cheek, and glistened
on the grizzled moustache where they had fallen.</p>

<p>"He was shot here," said the chief, pausing at the gate, "while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
breaking it in with his axe, and the shot came from that loophole.
When I got in, the man who fired it died with a blow where he sat,
so thou wert avenged, my poor hound. But what use is it, Meah,
now my slave is gone? Come; you have already seen enough of
this misery, and what is below there is worse. Will you go on?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I will go," returned Fazil. "I would know if one Vyas
Shastree was slain, with others."</p>

<p>"Vyas Shastree, Meah!" cried the chief. "Why, he was in the
temple. I saw him. Ah, the poor Shastree, I hope not, for I knew
him well&mdash;a learned Brahmun, sir; indeed come, search for him is
at least an object."</p>

<p>It was a terrible sight as they advanced. Why dwell on it? Many
bodies had been removed, and all the wounded; but many still
remained, men and women together, as yet unclaimed, and there was
blood everywhere, glistening and drying in the sun. Near the temple
porch were several bodies in a heap. Pahar Singh looked at them
all narrowly, but the Shastree was not among them. One of the
temple attendants was sitting in the vestibule, weeping in stupid
grief; the chief shook him roughly, roused him, and he got up.</p>

<p>"Didst thou see Vyas Shastree?" he asked; "was he hurt last
night?"</p>

<p>"He was killed," said the man, "there," and he pointed to the
entrance. "He was fighting, and a negro killed him. Ere day broke,
they took him up and carried him away."</p>

<p>"Dead?" asked Fazil.</p>

<p>"Dead," said the man,&mdash;"quite dead; I helped to put him upon the
litter they brought for him, and they have burned him by this time."</p>

<p>"And his wife?" asked the chief, "Anunda Bye?"</p>

<p>"Seek her at her house," said the man, turning away. "She was
not here, nor Radha Bye either. His daughter Tara was here, but
no one knows what became of her."</p>

<p>It was enough. The Shastree was dead. Another man who advanced
from behind the shrine said the same, and Fazil need ask no
more. He looked around&mdash;the place was slippery with blood, and
dark, except for a dim lamp in the shrine. He looked in,&mdash;the altar
was bloody, and the image, its rich clothes torn and dabbled in
blood, lay beneath, on its back, as it had fallen. The dim ray of the
lamp fell upon it, upon a few gold ornaments still about its neck and
arms, and upon the weird ruby eyes, that seemed to him to glow
with a fiendish expression of malice.</p>

<p>"Evil spirit," he said, turning away, "if thou art in being among
the devils, thou art at least helpless to rise, or to avenge thyself&mdash;lie
there for ever. Why does the blessed Alla suffer thy abomination?"</p>

<p>"Come away," cried Pahar Singh to the young man. "Faugh!
the place is evil; come&mdash;go not near the Mother, she may hurt thee."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you believe in her?" asked Fazil.</p>

<p>"I fear her," was the reply; "she is very greedy and very terrible:
she takes life for life, and more besides. Come&mdash;we will see after
these women: I know the Shastree's house."</p>

<p>Life for life, and more besides! Those words came back with a
strange vividness upon Fazil's memory in after times. Then, they
but excited a shudder of regret at the superstition which suggested
them.</p>

<p>"O that I had come up here, instead of going below!" said Fazil
to his companion. "Had I but known the place, I would have done
so. O my father, why was this done?"</p>

<p>"It could not have been stayed, Meah. As they say in Persian,
'Shooduni-Shooduni'&mdash;what is to be, is to be," returned Pahar
Singh; "nay, for that matter, why did I bring your father and his
men at all? Some of those pig-headed servants of Nimbalkur's
began it by shutting the gate, and killing my poor Rama; and after
the Peer Sahib's cry of 'Deen, Deen!' you might as well have tried
to stop the Beema in flood as the men. All I could do was to save
Nimbalkur and others, while the Peer was pulling down the Mother
from her altar, and spitting on her. Aha! holy priest! we shall see
who is strongest, the Mother or thee. Bless God for it, Meah, that
thy father had nothing to do with that; and when the Peer proposed
to send for cows to slay there, he would not have it done."</p>

<p>Fazil sighed. It was not that he feared the goddess Mother,
though of her power then, as now, there was an undefined dread
among Mahomedans, and ceremonies of propitiation, and deprecation
of evil, were often performed privately even among the most strict in
religious matters; but he dreaded the effect on the Mahratta people
at large. No one could know of the true reason of Afzool Khan's
advance on the town; the plunder and desecration of the temple
would seem to all to have been the actual purpose; and the deed
would produce a shudder of execration, he well knew, from one end
of Maharástra to the other.</p>

<p>Thus conversing, they reached the upper gate, where one of the
men in attendance on the dying retainer met them. The tears on
his face needed no speech to explain them. "He is dead," said the
man; "he never spoke afterwards."</p>

<p>"My poor fellow!" exclaimed Pahar Singh. "Ah! Meah, the
best swordsman, the best rider&mdash;hunchback as he was&mdash;the best at
all his weapons of all that I have; and the truest heart too, rough
and faithful. Well, no matter now. Is Lukshmun there?" he continued.</p>

<p>"No, master, he is not. We have sent for him."</p>

<p>"Do not delay. Bury Rama at once. I do but accompany the
young Khan; and then the horn will sound. Be quick."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span></p>

<p>They passed on, turning to the left, into a street which ascended
to a higher level in the town. As they proceeded, evidences of
plunder and violence were but too visible. Here a patch of blood on
the pavement still wet&mdash;there portions of cloths,&mdash;brass and copper
vessels dropped in flight,&mdash;doors broken in with axes, and the interior
courts of such houses as were entered in dire confusion&mdash;women and
men alike, weeping and wailing bitterly.</p>

<p>"This is the Shastree's house, Meah," said Pahar Singh; "enter
and see."</p>

<p>There was no one in it. They went to the end of the courts, even
to that in which was the temple and Tara's garden, all so trim and
neat. The body of an Abyssinian was lying among the flowers, and
another of a Mahratta near him. The sacred fire was still smouldering
on the altar, and Pahar Singh reverently lifted some logs of
wood, and put them on it. Here and there about the rooms were
splashes of blood and marks of violence, but none of the room doors
were open.</p>

<p>"Their property is safe, Meah," said the chief; "but who are
alive, and who dead? There is no one here. Let us ask the neighbours."</p>

<p>They inquired of several. One man said that Jánoo Näik and
the town Ramoosees had defended the house and beaten off plunderers;
but they knew nothing of the women.</p>

<p>"Come," said Pahar Singh to Fazil, "we lose time here. Let
us seek Jánoo Näik. I know him. He will be at the Kuchéri, and
will know;" and they went.</p>

<p>Jánoo was found, but he had no idea of telling Pahar Singh, the
robber chief, and a good-looking Mussulman, where he had hidden
Anunda and Radha, who, now safely delivered from their night-watch
on the ledge of the rock, had been guided by his son at early
daylight over the hill to the village of Afsinga, where they were in
safety. Jánoo had returned to his post; and if Fazil and Pahar
Singh had opened the kitchen door they would have found five of
his men in it, who had watched them narrowly, and were on guard
over the house.</p>

<p>To their united inquiries Jánoo had but one answer,&mdash;the Abyssinians
had attacked the house, carried off the women, and murdered
them. "Alas, alas!" he said, pretending to weep bitterly, "they had
not even Brahmuns' rites. They were flung into the trench without,
and buried with the rest. Alas, alas! and so beautiful as they
were. Do ye doubt? Look, here are some ornaments of theirs
which I am going to give to the Sirkar," and he showed a small
bundle tied up in a bloody cloth, the contents of which chinked as
he handled it.</p>

<p>"We can do nothing more, Meah," said Pahar Singh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span></p>

<p>"My lord, I ate their salt&mdash;why should I tell a lie?" he returned,
with a real expression of sorrow. "Go and see if they be in their
house." "They are after no good," thought Jánoo; "and if I could
only find Tara Bye, the Shastree would give me a gold kurra. At
any rate, I have prevented them asking more questions, I think."</p>

<p>"Poor girl," thought Fazil, "she is desolate indeed&mdash;father,
mother, all dead. Had they any relatives here?" he asked of the
Ramoosee.</p>

<p>"None, my lord. The Shastree's elder wife came from Wye in
the Concan, they say; and the last one, Moro Trimmul's sister, also
from thence. Here there is no one; and I would not tell them if
there were," he added to himself. "What do they want with them?"</p>

<p>"We had better go, Meah Sahib," said Pahar Singh. "I will but
tell Boorhan-oo-deen the Näik to seal up the house of the Shastree,
and guard it from plunder, and join thee at thy father's. Do not
wait for me."</p>

<p>Fazil went on sadly. The state of the girl whom he had already
rescued from violence, affected him deeply. So beautiful, so strangely
beautiful to him, unaccustomed to see the higher classes of Hindu
women. "O that Zyna was here," he thought. "She might be a
sister to her, and soothe away that grief. Who can break to her
what has happened?"</p>

<p>As Pahar Singh had predicted, Fazil found his father and the
Peer in the act of dismissing the Mahratta sirdars, apparently with
respect; for there was a silver bottle of uttar standing upon a salver,
and a tray with betel leaves on it, on the floor, in the centre of the
room. Ibrahim Khan and several other officers were sitting around,
and the priest had apparently relaxed from his devotional position.
A servant took up the salver and tray as Fazil entered, and the
chiefs prepared to rise at the signal, as did also the Khan.</p>

<p>"Have we leave to depart, Khan Sahib?" said an elderly man,
with long white moustaches.</p>

<p>"Depart in peace," replied Afzool Khan. "I think you all understand
now, that it happened inadvertently. 'Shooduni-Shooduni,'
you know&mdash;what was to be, was to be; and what is done, is done.
His Majesty shall hear favourably of your visit to me. Inshalla!
he will be satisfied; and all intended fines and confiscations will be
averted. Only for that Brahmun intriguer ye had been safe. Did
the royal troops ever interfere with ye before? Mashalla, no! Ul-humd-ul-illa.
No! Astagh-fur-oolla! No! and never will again."</p>

<p>"And the bounty for restoration of the temple, Khan Sahib?"
said the old chief inquiringly.</p>

<p>"Ahem! Good. I will see about it; yes, I have no doubt the
King will be merciful. Go in peace," said the Khan decidedly;
and, saluting them again, they passed out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span></p>

<p>"You see they are satisfied, son," said the Khan quickly; "we
have told them it could not have been helped, and they agree. Well,
what didst thou see? Did Pahar Singh tell thee how they fired
first?"</p>

<p>"He did, father! he told me all, and I have seen all. I pray the
merciful Alla never to show me such a sight again. O father, how
many houses are desolate and in misery which were happy homes
last night before we came!"</p>

<p>"Ameen! my son," returned the Khan, sighing: "yes, we all say
so now. Do we not, Huzrut? But they fired first, and what was
to be was to be!"</p>

<p>"And the idol was overthrown; that image of the devil's mother,"
cried the priest grimly. "Didst thou see that, Meah?"</p>

<p>"I did," said Fazil, "and rejoiced, though those devilish red eyes
haunt me still."</p>

<p>"I spat on them, Meah, while they glared at me from the ground,"
said the Peer savagely; "and I, too, see them still, flashing though
the priest's blood which gushed out upon them. But what fear,
Meah, what fear? What sayeth the holy book, chapter twenty-second?
'Verily the idols which ye provoke, beside God, can never
create even a single fly;' no, nor hurt one either, my son. Wherefore
there is no fear&mdash;no fear; be comforted."</p>

<p>Fazil thought the priest shuddered as he shrugged his shoulders,
and, shutting his eyes, settled himself once more on his heels, and
began telling his beads with great devoutness. So a general silence
fell among them.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_LX" id="CHAPTER_LX">CHAPTER LX.</a></h2>


<p>The silence was oppressive. The Khan was smoking, and the dull,
monotonous gurgle of the hookah went on incessantly, almost irritating
Fazil, and provoking him to speak again; but his father had
shut his eyes, and puffed mechanically, emitting the smoke through
his nostrils, and the priest was evidently absorbed in devotional contemplation.
Any interruption would be welcome.</p>

<p>"They have brought up the prisoner," said Ibrahim Khan, a
strangely silent man, but good soldier, who rarely spoke to any one.
"He is now entering the court door; shall he be ordered in?"</p>

<p>"Ay!" said Afzool Khan, "let him be disposed of before our
breakfast. That kichéri, Khan Sahib?"</p>

<p>"Inshalla, it will soon be ready; I will go and see to it," he replied;
and he got up and went out, as Gopal Singh, Lukshmun, and some
others entered. Moro Pundit was bound as before, with a turban<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
round his neck, the end of which was held by Lukshmun with one
hand, while the other grasped a heavy naked sabre. The girl Gunga
followed them.</p>

<p>Afzool Khan, the priest, and Fazil looked at the Brahmun from
head to foot; but he did not quail, or betray any emotion whatever,
except that his broad chest was heaving under the bandage, and his
hands, which just appeared below it, were tightly clenched.</p>

<p>"This is Moro Trimmul", said Gopal Singh; "we all know him.
He used to lodge here with the Gosais, and they are all here to speak
to him. Is it not true, O Bawas?" he continued to some of the
household who crowded in.</p>

<p>"It is he, my lord, sure enough," cried several of the Gosais in a
breath; "it is Moro Trimmul, who lived here."</p>

<p>"Have ye got his papers?" asked the priest.</p>

<p>"They are most likely in the panniers and bags on the ponies,"
said Gopal Singh, "or in the palankeen. What matter?&mdash;here is
the man himself."</p>

<p>"Ask him, my son, if he has aught to say. Ask him in his own
tongue," said the Khan. "We would not destroy him unheard."</p>

<p>Fazil put the question.</p>

<p>"I did not intend to speak," said Moro Trimmul, "for I am in
hands which know no mercy, and I need none. All who take work
like mine are prepared to die at any hour. All I ask of ye is to let
this girl go; she is a poor Moorlee who was faithful to me. Let her
go, Khan Sahib, with the gold I gave her. As for me, as you have
slain many innocent Brahmuns, I am not to be spared, for I have
done all I needed, and my mission is ended."</p>

<p>"What hast thou done?" asked the priest.</p>

<p>"Thou art a priest of thy faith," answered the man, "I one of
mine; what thou dost and wouldst do for thy faith, I would do and
have been doing for mine. Does that content thee?"</p>

<p>"Enough!" cried the Khan, "he confesses. What shall we do
with him?"</p>

<p>"Let him die, father," said Fazil solemnly. "He was contriving
more evil than you know of, as his face tells,&mdash;now look at it as I
speak,&mdash;yes: and he would have done it too. Let him die."</p>

<p>As Fazil spoke, a grey ashy paleness overspread the Brahmun's
face, and a shudder passed through him; but he did not answer, and
taking, as it were, a long inspiration, drew himself up to his full
height, closing his fingers convulsively.</p>

<p>"Fazil," asked his father, "dost thou say death, my son?"</p>

<p>"I do," said Fazil, "in justice for this man's evil deeds, which
have brought misery to hundreds, and will yet cause more."</p>

<p>"Shabash," cried the priest, "Ul-humd-ul-illa! there is good stuff
in thee yet, Meah. What sayeth the holy book, chapter forty-seven?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
'When ye encounter the unbelievers, strike off their heads, until ye
have made a great slaughter.' Yes, let him die."</p>

<p>Afzool Khan mused for a while. The priest's quotation was
correct, and his own fanaticism confirmed it. Was he, however, so
appalled by the recent destruction of innocent Hindu life, that he
hesitated as to this one? or was it in regard to the fact that Moro
Trimmul was a Brahmun, and the popular objection to putting such
men to death being great, that he now hesitated? Both causes
probably combined to influence him.</p>

<p>"I am not going to do it, Punditjee," said Lukshmun to Moro
Trimmul in a whisper, "because thou art a Brahmun; but there is
no harm wishing thee as sharp a sword as this is. See!"</p>

<p>Moro Trimmul looked askance at the hunchback as he would have
done at a reptile, and shrank instinctively from him. They saw his
eye wander along the edge of the bright blade from hilt to point;
but though he shuddered perceptibly, he said nothing.</p>

<p>Afzool Khan took his chin and beard in his hand, leaned his elbow
on his knee, looked furtively once or twice under his bushy eyebrows
at the priest and Fazil in turn, but did not speak, and again resumed
his position. The prisoner's large bright eyes were fixed on him with
an intensely inquisitive and earnest expression, and drops of sweat
gathered on his brow and temples; but though his life hung on a
word, there was no fear visible, and Fazil could not repress admiration
of the man's calm bearing and contempt of death.</p>

<p>"It cannot be, Huzrut, yet," said Afzool Khan at length; "we
have much to learn from him; and, after all, son, he was but doing
his duty truly and faithfully. If I had sent thee on such an errand,
or the King had sent thee, wouldst thou not have done the same?
Take him away, put irons on him. He must be sent to the King,
and judged at Beejapoor."</p>

<p>"Where thou wilt die under the Goruk Imlee tree like Jehándar
Beg," said Lukshmun. "Ah, yes, that was a clean stroke of Rama's;
and they don't care for Brahmuns there."</p>

<p>At that moment Pahar Singh entered. "Yes, that is the man,"
he said, looking intently at the Brahmun. Then turning to his
follower, "Go, Lukshmun," he said, "they seek thee. Rama is dead,
and thou shouldst go and pour the water at his burial."</p>

<p>"Dead!" cried the man, starting back, and dropping the end of
the turban. "Dead! O no, master, not Rama!"</p>

<p>"Go, and thou wilt see," said the chief, turning away.</p>

<p>Lukshmun spoke no word. They saw his broad chest heaving,
and he gasped for breath. The shock was too sudden and great, and
he fell senseless against the wall. In doing so the gold zone which
he had hung over his arm rolled away.</p>

<p>"It is mine," said Gunga, picking it up, and clasping it about her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
waist. "He gave it me, ask him;" and she pointed to the Brahmun;
"ask him; and that fellow would have stolen it. May I go?" she
continued, addressing the Khan; "I am only a poor Moorlee of the
temple; you do not need me."</p>

<p>"Surely," said the Khan, "we want no women. Go!" and she
made a humble salutation to him, and turned aside.</p>

<p>"Is he, too, dead?" asked Pahar Singh, turning to Lukshmun.
"They were twins, ye see, sirs," he said to the bystanders, "and his
spirit may have gone after his brother's."</p>

<p>But it was not so. Lukshmun had fainted, and revived as water
was poured down his throat and a man fanned him with a cloth.
He looked about him dreamily; then some one raised him up, and
led him away.</p>

<p>"And he?" asked Pahar Singh of the Khan, pointing to Moro
Trimmul. "Is he to die? what will ye do with him, Khan Sahib?"</p>

<p>"Not yet; he will go to Beejapoor," returned the Khan, "and
answer for his deeds to the King."</p>

<p>"It is just," replied the chief; "he has only done what a good
servant should do. He tempted me for his master, as I could have
tempted him&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That is just what I said," said the Khan, interrupting.</p>

<p>"And he took no man's life," continued the chief, "and the law
will spare his."</p>

<p>"The law," interrupted the priest scornfully, "the blessed law is
not for infidels, save for their destruction. For what is written in
chapter forty-seven&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Peace," cried the Khan, who dreaded a dispute between them,
"let it pass. I have spared him. Take him away&mdash;keep him with
the standard of the Paigah, and let no man or woman have speech
of him; he can cook his own food."</p>

<p>They led Moro Trimmul away. He said nothing; but Fazil saw a
smile of triumph, he thought, flash over his grave features. When
they looked for the girl Gunga she had gone also, and was not to be
seen. Fazil, too, had disappeared. As the Khan's breakfast was
brought, the kichéri and kabobs he loved so well, he washed his
hands, and waited awhile for Fazil's return; but able to contain
himself no longer, drew near to the smoking dish, and crying, "Bismilla!"
he, the priest, and those present, after the necessary ablutions,
plunged their hands into the pile of rice, and ate heartily.</p>

<p>Fazil could no longer restrain himself. He had promised the girl
he had left below the pass, to get news of her people for her; and,
taking advantage of Pahar Singh's entrance, and the confusion
occasioned by Lukshmun's fall, had slipped out unobserved. It was
but a short distance, his horse was still saddled, and he mounted and
rode as rapidly as he could down the hill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span></p>

<p>The men were where he had left them, under the trees by the
rivulet. Shêre Khan was on foot, standing by the palankeen, pointing
to the road and to Fazil as he descended. Some of the men were
on horseback, others lying in the shade holding their horses' bridles.</p>

<p>As he neared the palankeen, the old man slowly advanced, and
Fazil could see there were tears on his furrowed cheek. He saluted
the young Khan respectfully, and put his hand on his saddle-bow.</p>

<p>"I never saw grief like hers," he said, "nor such fear, nor misery,
at your delay. 'Why did he go?' was all she could say at first&mdash;and
since I soothed her, she has cried the more&mdash;'Why doth he
delay?' Once I persuaded her to go and wash her face at the river
and drink water, and she did so, and was the better of it. And,
O Meah! she is so beautiful! Even our rough men say she is a Peri,
not a woman. Speak gently to her, Meah."</p>

<p>Fazil dismounted and walked on. A large space had been left
about the palankeen, and no one had intruded upon Tara. Towards
the rivulet the doors were open, and she was sitting on the edge of
the litter, but with her feet on the ground without, and her face
buried in her knees. She did not look up till the young man was
close to her; then, with irrepressible emotion, she threw herself at
his feet.</p>

<p>"O take me to them!" she cried piteously&mdash;"take me to them!
they are waiting for me, they are looking for their Tara! O sir,
they will not rest, or eat, till they know I am safe. Let me go&mdash;take
me to them. Why am I detained? I have done no evil!"</p>

<p>"Rise," said Fazil, "rise&mdash;I may not touch thee to raise thee up;
but Alla has laid a heavy hand on thee, and thou must listen to true
words, though they bring thee such affliction as thou hast not known
in thy young life."</p>

<p>Tara raised herself to her knees and looked up. O, the misery of
those great eyes in which were no tears&mdash;red, dry, and glistening:
while the sweet features quivered under bewildering anticipations
of what was to follow. Fazil could not bear to look on her, and
turned away. "Would there were anyone else to tell thee but me,"
he said, "it would be well."</p>

<p>"Speak," she replied calmly, "there is no deceit in your tongue&mdash;he
whom you left with me says so; he told me you would not deceive
me, and this suspense is terrible, do not prolong it&mdash;speak. I will
listen."</p>

<p>"Nor will I," returned Fazil; "sit down as thou wast, and may
God keep thy heart, as I tell thee of thy misery. Yesterday there
were a father, a mother, another wife, and thyself, in a happy home.
Now three are gone, and thou art here."</p>

<p>He saw her, as he spoke, clutching nervously at her throat, which
was heaving convulsively, and trying to swallow; and ere he could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
complete the sentence she had fallen sideways from her seat against
the door of the litter, and lay there, powerless, for an instant. His
habitual respect for women would have prevented his touching her,
but she was so helpless that he raised her up, and, taking a pillow
from the inside of the palankeen, placed it behind her, supporting it
with his arm.</p>

<p>Gradually she seemed to recover a little. "Dead," she said gently,
"all dead! O Holy Mother, why is this? Why am I not taken
too?" and she shuddered, and cowered down, shrinking from him.</p>

<p>Fazil thought the truth might rouse her, and he was right. He
dreaded her becoming insensible.</p>

<p>"Yes, so it has pleased God," he said. "Thy father was killed,
fighting in the temple; and in the confusion afterwards, robbers
attacked the house where your mother was and the other, and they
also died."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no, it could not be!" cried Tara, quickly and eagerly.
"Jánoo Näik would be there; he would fight for them and protect
them."</p>

<p>"Jánoo himself told me this: he told me he saw them dead&mdash;two
women, very fair, the elder Anunda, and the younger wife, Radha
Bye. Some of Jánoo's people are killed in the house, and he could
not save them. Thy father?" he continued, as he saw her lips apparently
moving, though the word was not spoken. "Yes, two men,
priests in the temple, Khundoo Bhópey and Rama Bhópey&mdash;I asked
their names&mdash;who lifted him upon the litter in which he was carried
away, said he was dead and already burned. What can I do with
thee or for thee now?" he continued. "Speak, and I will do it, lady,
truly and faithfully."</p>

<p>"Is it true?" she asked dreamily, and with a rough husky voice,
and staring at him with those great scared eyes. "The Bhópeys
would not tell lies."</p>

<p>"I swear it by the dead, it is true," replied Fazil. "I have neither
rested nor eaten till I found out the truth. Had there been any one,
even a servant, I would have sent for thee. Jánoo told me there
was no one belonging to thee in the town, no relatives;&mdash;and the
Brahmuns are all fled. Men say they will not return to a polluted
shrine, and Jánoo Näik and others said you had relatives at Wye,
where we are going."</p>

<p>"Yes," she said calmly, and as if echoing his words, "there are
relatives at Wye. Sukya Bye is there&mdash;and&mdash;no matter. Yes. I will
go there&mdash;let me go."</p>

<p>"My mother and sister will be with us," added Fazil, "come to
them. Zyna will be a sister to thee, and no harm shall come nigh
thee. I would use no force&mdash;it must be of thine own free will; but
the town yonder is filled with dead and dying, the temple is desolate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
there is no one of thy people alive, and thou wouldst die of fear and
sorrow. Come with us; Shêre Khan will take care of thee, as of a
daughter, till we reach my sister. I will not come nigh thee, but
he will tell me of thee. O lady, I am not false! I am a stranger to
thee; but Alla threw me in thy path, when else, dishonour was before
thee. From that, at least, I saved thee, and thou knowest it."</p>

<p>"Who art thou?" she said gently; "yes, I was saved from worse
than death&mdash;who saved me?"</p>

<p>"I, Fazil, the son of Afzool Khan of Beejapoor," he said.</p>

<p>"They say Pathans respect women's honour," she returned, rousing
herself. "A poor orphan girl will not be without pity in your sight.
Ah! sir, I am sorely bewildered now," she continued, beating helplessly
with her hands on her lap. "I cannot think or speak, and my
heart is dried up; but he told me&mdash;that old man&mdash;that you were true,
and they loved you, all of them!&mdash;and so be kind to Tara, and do
not deceive her; she will die soon, and go away, and will trouble you
no more."</p>

<p>"By Alla! by my sister's honour! I will be true to thee, O lady!"
cried Fazil earnestly; "truer than thou canst now think. Enough;
when thou art with Zyna thou wilt know all; till then thou wilt not
see me. Call the bearers," he continued, to Shêre Khan; "take her on
to camp, wherever it is; get guides from the next village yonder.
Procure her food by the way, if she will eat. Here are twenty men
with the litter; they will take thee into Sholapoor. Hark!" he continued
to the men as they approached, "take this palankeen into
Sholapoor at once, and ye shall have fifty rupees from Afzool Khan.
Fear not, lady!" he said once more to Tara; "thou wilt be Shêre
Khan's daughter till thou art with my sister." Then, mounting his
horse, he rode rapidly up the pass.</p>

<p>Tara followed his figure with her eyes, and her heart went with
them. He was so kind, so gracious, and so beautiful. She could
not realize the fact of her sudden misery and desolation, and yet she
could not doubt it. As he disappeared behind a turn in the road, the
sense of that desolation became more acutely painful. But she had
no time for thought. Shêre Khan rode up, bid her shut the doors of
the litter, and told her he should not leave it; and a moment afterwards
she felt it was taken up, and carried forward at a rapid pace,
while the old soldier caracoled by her side, and the horsemen spread
themselves around her, to screen as well as to protect the conveyance
in which she lay.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_LXI" id="CHAPTER_LXI">CHAPTER LXI.</a></h2>


<p>Fazil Khan rode rapidly up the pass, for he knew his father would
await his coming ere he gave the final orders for the march. Truth
to say, he was hungry enough, and a breakfast upon Ibrahim Khan's
kichéri and kabobs would be very welcome. As he reached the top,
a busy scene presented itself. Wherever he looked, little fires were
lighted between three large stones, upon which the small cooking-pans
used by the men, and carried in their saddle-bags, were placed;
and the savoury smells which issued from them, and pervaded the
air, proved that the stews and curries within were in very satisfactory
progress, and were certainly very provocative of appetite. While
one member of a small mess watched the pot, others were kneading
dough, or patting out "chupatees" or unleavened cakes, with their
hands, and baking them on their "towas" or iron plates. Hundreds
of these operations were going on simultaneously in every direction;
for the force had a long day's march before it to Sholapoor. There
would be no midway halt, and men and horses must alike be fed.
Everywhere, too, the merry laugh, the broad joke or banter incidental
to camp life, resounded among the rude soldiery, and the
cries of sellers of milk, curds, firewood, and fruit, mingled with them
pleasantly.</p>

<p>Already was the scene of the night before forgotten. The dead
for the most part had been buried out of sight; and if grief and
misery sat at the heart of many a household in the town&mdash;mourning
for relations slain, or property plundered or destroyed,&mdash;in the camp
without, no such feelings existed among the fierce and fanatical men.
A grim satisfaction prevailed at having defiled one of the holiest
shrines of the Dekhan, plundered its property, and slain its priests.
To all, the night's events had been those of ordinary skirmish and
excitement: forgotten with the next petty cares of life, and anticipation
of new scenes of adventure,&mdash;and possibly of new plunder.</p>

<p>"Where hast thou been, Meah Sahib?" cried one of a knot of his
own men, whom he met almost as he reached the plain above the
pass. "The Khan Sahib has been searching for thee, and is anxious.
Ah! when wilt thou learn caution, and take some of us at least with
thee? Remember this is not Beejapoor, and the people are not in
good humour after last night. Any fellow with a gun behind one of
those rocks&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thanks, friend," said Fazil, interrupting him. "I did but go to
Shêre Khan and the rest of them below, and tell them to precede
us; but thanks for the caution nevertheless. Now, get ready soon,
for I shall not be long away from ye," and he cantered on to the town.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span></p>

<p>Giving directions for a led horse to be accoutred for him, in lieu
of that which had carried him through the night, Fazil entered the
Mutt where he had left his father, and found him girding himself
for the journey.</p>

<p>"Where hast thou been, son? we could not wait; but they have
kept the kichéri hot for thee, and the kabobs are good; only they
have too much pepper and garlic in them. The Khan's cookery is
not refined, my son: not like thy mother's. Inshalla! she will have
a famous dish ready for us this evening, for I am going to send on a
camel. Hast thou any message?"</p>

<p>Fazil knew by his father's volubility that he was in good humour.
The flurried, anxious expression of his face had departed, as well
under the influence of a hearty breakfast as owing to the feeling
that, under the circumstances, he had really done his best to smooth
over the events of the night. It was unfortunate, certainly, that
they had happened; but it could not be helped now. A donation
from the King would soothe the Brahmuns. So he had again sent
for the local Näik, and charged him to assure all of his sympathy and
sorrow. Afzool Khan had taken advantage of the Peer's absence to
do this, for in his presence he would have feared to commit himself
by expression of any consideration for infidels.</p>

<p>"I did but ride down the pass, father," replied Fazil, "to speak
with Shêre Khan, and send him on to camp. They will halt by-and-by,
and refresh themselves. Yes, truly, something to eat will
be welcome; therefore, sit down and rest. We have a long ride
before us."</p>

<p>"The camel is ready," said the rider of it, entering. "What are
your orders?"</p>

<p>"Write a line from me to thy mother, Fazil," said the Khan, "to
say she is to have kichéri and kabobs ready for us, and that we have
won a victory with little loss. That will cheer her, and put her in
mind of old days, and we shall have a glorious dish. Inshalla! we
shall be hungry, son!"</p>

<p>Fazil wrote what was needed to Lurlee, and added, on separate
paper, a few lines to Zyna, to take care of Tara on her arrival.
There was no time to write her story, but she would hear particulars
from Tara herself. "Take this at your best speed," he said to the
man. "Give it into the hands of Goolab Daee, and tell her it is for
my sister only. You will overtake Shêre Khan by the way. Tell
him to stop where he likes, refresh the men and horses, and push on.
It is of moment that he should arrive before us, and he is already
far beyond Sindphul."</p>

<p>"Good," replied the man; "your orders are on my head and eyes,
and shall be done." In a few moments more, the clash of the bells
of the animal he rode were heard as he started, and then died away
in the distance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span></p>

<p>What was best to be done?&mdash;to tell his father of Tara's being sent
on under escort of the men, or to leave explanation about her till they
reached Sholapoor? Fazil thought over this as he ate, and he ate
heartily what was brought, and did justice to it; while his father
sat and looked on approvingly, or told his son of what had been done
to assure the people, and what he would do, in spite of the Peer, to
obtain a donation for the temple. "Yes, it will be better to tell him,"
Fazil thought. "He will not object, as he is in this complacent
humour, and we are alone."</p>

<p>"I had no opportunity of speaking, father, before, else I would
have told you," he said, after he had washed his hands and sat down.</p>

<p>"What!" interrupted the Khan, who detected a tone of embarrassment
in Fazil's voice&mdash;"what has happened? Didst thou lose any
men? Who is dead?"</p>

<p>"No, no, father, we had no fighting," replied Fazil. "All I had
to say was, that I sent the lady we took, with Shêre Khan. She
had a palankeen, and the bearers said they would take her to Sholapoor
at once. There were twenty of them, and it is only twelve
coss."</p>

<p>"A lady, son! Who?" he answered in an indifferent tone.</p>

<p>"A Brahmun girl, father, of rank. She was escaping in a palankeen,
and we took her when we took Moro Pundit."</p>

<p>"Indeed! His wife perhaps?"</p>

<p>"No, father; she said not. She has nothing to do with him; but
she was in such grief at her people being killed in the town, that I
could only make out she had relatives at Wye, and I sent her on
under Shêre Khan. As she was richly dressed, and had valuable
jewels on her, I feared to send her back, and she was willing to go."</p>

<p>"Poor girl, poor girl," said the Khan, sighing; "and she is young,
you say. Alas, alas! to be so soon a widow!"</p>

<p>"Quite young, father&mdash;sixteen, perhaps&mdash;and very beautiful. O,
so beautiful! I never saw one like her before."</p>

<p>"Wonderful!" returned the Khan. "Then she let thee see her?...
Ah, Pahar Singh, well, so you are already prepared," he exclaimed,
as the chief entered the room suddenly, and saluted them.
"Have you eaten? Are your people ready? We go on to Sholapoor."</p>

<p>"I am come to bid you farewell, my lord," said the chief. "I have
done my work with you for the present. My duty is not with the
army, but on the marches; and I hear of a raid by the Golconda
people which I must see to. My nephew Gopal Singh would fain
have accompanied your son, but I cannot spare him. He is my only
stay since&mdash;since ... no matter. My men would be worse than
useless to you, and you will not miss what I could send. Nevertheless,
if&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, no," said the Khan, who in truth had dreaded rather than
desired Pahar Singh's company, and that of his lawless freebooters;
"no, you are better here in your own country, and I have already
weakened the force too much at Nuldroog to withdraw you."</p>

<p>"Then we may go, Khan?"</p>

<p>"Certainly; you are honourably dismissed with thanks, and mention
will be made of you, when I write, as you deserve."</p>

<p>"I have only one thing to say, Khan Sahib,&mdash;and I pray you to
pardon my saying it,&mdash;and that is, beware of Moro Pundit. Had I
been a Mussulman like you, I had not spared him: but as you have
done so, it is not for me, a Rajpoot, to be concerned in a Brahmun's
death. He is faithful to his cause, and he cannot be true to you."</p>

<p>"He can do no harm, friend," said the Khan, laughing. "I fancy
the Nimbalkur and others have had a good lesson, and will keep quiet;
and, for the rest, as I am going to scotch the head of the snake, we
need not fear if its tail writhes a little; it can do no harm: but I
thank you for your caution nevertheless, and you will see to my
people of Afzoolpoor and its villages?"</p>

<p>"Surely, Khan Sahib; be under no apprehension&mdash;nothing can
molest them. Now, put your hand on my head once more, embrace
me, and let me go."</p>

<p>"Go," said the Khan, rising and doing as he wished&mdash;"go; be
careful, friend; remember the royal clemency, and be true."</p>

<p>"Will you come with me for a moment, Meah?" said Pahar Singh,
as he disengaged himself from the Khan's embrace.</p>

<p>Fazil got up and followed him. As they emerged from the courtyard
into the street, Fazil saw that Gopal Singh and others, ready
mounted, awaited their chief, and they saluted him courteously.</p>

<p>"Come hither, Lukshmun," said the chief.</p>

<p>The man was well mounted, and advanced. Fazil saw that his
cheeks were wet with tears, and his eyes red and swollen. Hideous
as the face now was, there was a dignity of sorrow in it which was
not unimpressive.</p>

<p>"Meah," said the chief, "this is a foolish slave of mine, who implores
me to send him with you; he wants no pay,&mdash;only food and
clothes, and forage for his horse. He will be faithful to you in all
danger and trial, and knows no fear. When you return from the
campaign, send him to me again. Do you accept him?"</p>

<p>"I do, Pahar Singh, and will be to him as you were, that I promise,"
replied Fazil.</p>

<p>"Then dismount and kiss the young Khan's feet," said the chief.</p>

<p>Lukshmun obeyed him, dismounted, and prostrating himself before
Fazil, embraced his knees. He then did the same to his master,
lying at his feet, and sobbing bitterly.</p>

<p>"Get up, fool," said the chief kindly, drawing the back of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
hand roughly across his eyes. "Go, thou art safer with him than
with me, go! Take him, Meah," he continued, putting the man's
hand into Fazil's, who raised him up. "Take him; he will be to
you the faithful hound he was to me and my boy yonder: we can
ill spare him, but, after what has happened, he is better away for a
while. And now, sir, we part. Remember what I said to your
father, and that while Mahrattas are weak they will be treacherous.
I wish you well; in the words of your people, 'Khôda Hafiz.'"</p>

<p>So saying, the chief mounted, caused his spirited horse to execute
several caracoles and plunges, and, with his nephew and followers,
rode off rapidly to the plain beyond, where the shrill horn and deep
drum of his troop were sounding the assembly.</p>

<p>"Had it been thus if you knew me, Pahar Singh?" thought Fazil,
as the last of the rough troopers passed round the corner of the
buildings to the plain beyond. "Hardly, I think; but it is well as
it is, and your goodwill is better than your spite." As he turned
round he saw the hunchback beside him. The bridle of his horse
was hooked within his left arm; his hands, joined together, were
raised to his nose, and he had balanced himself on his left leg, with
the sole of the right foot pressed against the calf of the left. His
grotesque features were twisted into a curious expression, in which
grief and joy struggled for mastery.</p>

<p>"Your name is Lukshmun?" said Fazil.</p>

<p>"My lord, it is; I am your slave now and for ever:&mdash;till I die, if
you permit me to serve you in my own way."</p>

<p>"And that is?"</p>

<p>"No matter now," said the creature; "you will find out. If I
displease you, I will go away of my own accord and give no trouble;
if I please you, let me be near you, and that is enough."</p>

<p>"How is this? You talk like a woman."</p>

<p>"Do you know anything of them, master?" replied the man.
"Perhaps not; it takes a long life to know them, they say. Do I
talk like a woman? Ah no, sir; to me you are the woman who has
bewitched me, and I follow you blindly for the sake of the love I
have for you, which sits in my heart."</p>

<p>"Since when, friend?" said Fazil, laughing.</p>

<p>"Since last night, when you were kind to that poor Brahmun girl
who owes her honour to you, and long before that, of which I will
tell you another time. Can I do anything now?"</p>

<p>"Hast thou eaten?"</p>

<p>"Yes; and I have enough here to last me two days," and he
pointed to a bundle of cakes tied at his back. "I can give you one
if you like, when you are hungry."</p>

<p>"I do not want it&mdash;I have eaten," said Fazil. "Can I trust thee
already?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span></p>

<p>"O, master!" cried the man piteously, as the tears started suddenly
to his eyes. "Do not say that! I am a poor hunchback, who
cannot say fine words, what is the use of my talking? If you mistrust
me, bid me go. I will return to him who gave me to you&mdash;better
that, than be doubted. Enough, shall I go?"</p>

<p>"No, stay," continued Fazil; "I will trust thee. Tie thy horse
there, and give him some fodder from the bundle yonder.... That
is well. Now go to the Kuchéri; say to the Näik, that Fazil Khan
Meah wants the bundle of things given to him by Jánoo Näik, and
he is to give it."</p>

<p>"And what if Jánoo is there, master? he will not allow it."</p>

<p>"That is why I do not go myself," said Fazil; "but if there is
any difficulty I will come. Show this as a token, and it will suffice,"
and he took off his signet-ring.</p>

<p>"I will bring them without this, Meah, and yet I take it. Tell
some one to mind the mare, else if she hears the horn she will break
her rope;" and the man, throwing his coarse black blanket over him,
shambled off at a quick pace towards the town. It was but a short
distance. Fazil waited there looking at his own horses which were
picketed in the street. He had no desire to rejoin his father, who
was quietly smoking within. Fortunately, too, the priest rode up;
said he wanted a hookah, dismounted, and went into the Mutt. He
would be company enough.</p>

<p>Fazil watched the street narrowly. Had he done right in sending
Lukshmun&mdash;ought he not to have gone himself? He could yet go
if there were refusal, but there might be no occasion. In a little
time, less then he had supposed possible, he saw the hunchback
coming up the street at a sharp run, and as he reached Fazil, he put
into his hand a heavy bundle of what felt like ornaments of gold
and silver, tied in a cloth which was spotted with blood.</p>

<p>"Shabash!" cried Fazil, "it was well contrived. How didst thou
get them?"</p>

<p>"Jánoo Näik is an ass, and the father of all the asses in Tooljapoor.
I know him of old," returned Lukshmun. "He was there sitting
like a scared owl on the steps of the Kuchéri. 'Come and drink,'
says he to me. 'I will,' said I; 'wait, I have a message from the
master to deliver.' Then I went in, and said to a Karkoon, 'Give
me what Jánoo gave just now, the people are come for it.' He
could not go in there, for he is a Mang. 'Take them,' says a Karkoon,
opening a box; 'I don't like to touch them, they are bloody.' So I
took them out, master, and here they are. As I passed Jánoo, I
gave him a rupee, and told him to go to the Kullal's and get some
drink ready, while I delivered my message&mdash;and he is gone. O, the
owl, the owl! he will be drunk by this time; but, master, that man
is as true as steel, and put these in trust; they were not loot to
him. Wilt thou sell them here? No, not here?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sell them!" cried Fazil, laughing; "no, surely&mdash;why?"</p>

<p>"O, the master never does&mdash;he always keeps the gold and silver,
and buys them at his own valuation; but he gives us a share, nevertheless,
and I shall miss mine of last night's work:&mdash;better, however,
that the women have it."</p>

<p>"Ah! friend, I fear thou wilt have no such luck with me," returned
the young man. "That is no loot, however; it will only go
to its owner."</p>

<p>"Ah, Meah, I understand now," said the man quickly. "Yes, for
her. Poor child! poor child! and when she sees the blood!&mdash;better
throw that cloth away, and tie them up in a clean handkerchief."</p>

<p>"No," said Fazil, "keep it. It is evidence of the worst, and she
needs to know it; but let us count them. Thirteen, you see, gold
and silver; and look, there is blood on these anklets&mdash;let it stay.
Yes, now I will trust thee."</p>

<p>Just then the Khan and the priest came out of the court, both
accoutred for the march.</p>

<p>"I was seeing to the horses, father," said Fazil, in anticipation of
his father's remarks, "and questioning this gift of Pahar Singh's;
look at him&mdash;a strange being, is he not?"</p>

<p>Lukshmun advanced, prostrated himself, kissed the Khan's feet,
but said nothing. The priest was acknowledged by a distant but
respectful reverence only, and the hunchback seemed to regard him
with antipathy.</p>

<p>"Strange enough, son," said the Khan, looking at him from head
to foot: "ask thy mother about his horoscope when we get to camp.
He may be lucky, after all&mdash;these hunchbacks often are so."</p>

<p>"My lord," said Lukshmun pleadingly, joining his hands, "all
the Brahmuns like to try their hands on my nativity, and they all
say I am lucky. For I am a twin, and they never could make out
exactly which of the two was the eldest born; but they believed
Rama was, who was always unlucky, and had a bad wife and worse
children, and he was shot yesterday; so the bad luck and bad stars&mdash;sun
and moon, and all&mdash;went with him; and now your slave is
the luckiest of men, since he is the property of the noble Afzool
Khan and his son Fazil. Surely the stars sent him."</p>

<p>"Thou hast a bold tongue," said the priest. "Peace, be silent."</p>

<p>"Ah, Maharaj!" returned the man, "holy men like you and the
Brahmuns think too much upon divine glories, to mind what a poor
fool like me says. I, too, know my prayers already, and shall
become a Mussulman, when I have heard a few more of your reverence's
sermons. O, they are wonderful! Bismilla&mdash;ir-rahman-ir-raheem!&mdash;--"</p>

<p>"Come," said the Khan, "they are beating the Nagárás everywhere,
and as all are ready, we need not delay." So, mounting their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
horses, which were being led about, they rode on to the plain where
the men were assembling fast, and closing in heavy masses upon
their several standards. In a few minutes, the Paigah of Afzool
Khan, Moro Pundit being in the midst closely guarded, moved on
down the pass, followed by the Abyssinian cavalry; and their bright
steel morions, gay scarves, trappings and standards, gleamed in the
blazing sunshine. Yet it was not hot enough to be oppressive; a
fresh westerly wind had arisen, driving before it large masses of
fleecy cloud, which, as they passed, threw broad chequers of light
and shade over the plain, rustling among the tall ripe corn, which
bowed before it in golden wavy ripples, and refreshing the men who,
though few had slept, were as yet unconscious of fatigue under the
excitement they had gone through.</p>

<p>The people of the town watched the long line, that, owing to the
rough nature of the road, straggled down the pass, with thankful
hearts for deliverance from further molestation; and as the last of
the men disappeared behind a shoulder of the mountain, a faint
shout of "Jey Kalee! Jey Toolja!" rose from a group of men, consisting
of the Nimbalkur and other chiefs who were assembling at
his house. Others clustered about the edge of the tableland, and
when they saw the long line emerge upon the plain beyond the
groves and gardens of Sindphul, and heard the loud booming notes
of the Nagárás growing fainter in the distance, many a heart
breathed a prayer of thanks for deliverance, intermingled with
defiance and deep curses on those from whose violence they had
suffered.</p>

<p>In the temple a group of priests were sitting about the shrine
weeping, and the image of the goddess still lay on its back, the
ruby eyes flashing in the glare of the lamps now lighted about it.
No one, as yet, dared to touch it, without some preliminary ceremonies
of deprecation of her wrath. Within, the blood had been
washed away&mdash;but without, in the court, it still lay in patches,
blackening and cracking in the sun.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_LXII" id="CHAPTER_LXII">CHAPTER LXII.</a></h2>


<p>There is nothing, perhaps, more effectual to deaden, if not to relieve
recent misery, than the sensation of rapid motion. Leaning back in
the palankeen, with the doors now shut, and the fresh breeze blowing
refreshingly through the open blinds, Tara felt herself hurried
swiftly and smoothly along, while her attention was at once occupied
and distracted by the occurrences of the journey. Sindphul, its
temple and trees: the lane which was the bed of the rivulet, through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
which the bearers plashed rapidly: the village gate now shut, and its
bastions manned with men to keep out marauders: the long shady
narrow lane, overhung with trees;&mdash;then, beyond, the plain, covered
with rich crops of grain now ripening: the shouts of the men and
boys, perched upon their stages in the fields, slinging stones at
birds: the song, drawling and monotonous, of the bullock-drivers at
the wells,&mdash;were all familiar objects and sounds to the desolate girl
being carried rapidly by them. Would she ever see them again?</p>

<p>As they passed their own garden, she looked among the trees&mdash;perchance
she might see Sudba, the old bullock-driver, or Purésh-ram,
the gardener; but there was no one visible, else she had cried
out to them. Were they dead, too? Ah! how often had she wandered
among the trees there with her mother, and watched the
butterflies among the flowers! The bearers stopped to change opposite
the wicket gate, and she could see the bright beds of white
jessamine, unpicked as yet, and large marigolds, and white and
yellow chrysanthemums, which the men were saving for the Dusséra.
Who would gather them now? Over them, the same bright yellow
and white butterflies were hovering in hundreds, and the fierce green
and blue dragonflies chasing each other, or darting here and there,
quick as thought, and glistening in the sun. Then she remembered
the omen in her garden as she sat spinning, and fell back on the
pillow shuddering. It was true. She remembered too that the bird
had sat for a while, and twittered a sweet low song. Was he that
bird, that noble, gracious youth, who had spoken to her so gently, so
kindly? She tried to follow the thread of this thought back, but
failed. Her mind was sadly confused and wandering, now reverting
to the omen, now to the objects she was passing, and the people they
met:&mdash;who were they? what doing? whither going?&mdash;to the horsemen,
the monotonous tramp of whose horses never ceased, some behind,
some before, some around her,&mdash;fierce, dark-bearded fellows, whose
very proximity she would have dreaded before,&mdash;who were now
guarding her respectfully by his order; while the kind old man, to
whose charge she had been specially committed, rode close to the side
of the litter, and where the path was narrow, asked her, through the
blinds, if she were well, and wanted anything.</p>

<p>Fazil, son of Afzool; she remembered the name. It was strange
to Hindu lips, but had a musical cadence, which her memory retained
as she repeated it to herself. Fazil, son of Afzool; and he had a
sister Zyna. What would she be like? Would she be kind and
loving to her? like Radha? Was he not beautiful, and very fair,
almost ruddy.</p>

<p>Into all these channels, confused, and whirling her mind hither and
thither like dust and straws before the wind, her thoughts wandered
dreamily, apparently avoiding the bare, hideous fact that all were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
dead whom she loved&mdash;all who had protected her up to last night.
But this would not long be denied its place. It was a horrible
reality not as yet fully understood:&mdash;which her gentle mind could
not grasp.</p>

<p>Dead! who saw them die? They were alive last night,&mdash;who had
killed them? If she had seen them die, that, indeed, would be
surety. No, it was not true. They could not be dead,&mdash;they could
not have left her so helpless. It was some fraud, some deception.
She had not gone far: Sindphul was close by: she would run and sit
in the garden, and wait for her mother; and she half-opened the door
of the litter. Shêre Khan rode by it, erect and stern, but bowed
down to her as the door moved. "Do you want anything, lady?" he
said. "Go to sleep; it will rest you."</p>

<p>The voice, kind as it was, dispelled the other thought, and brought
back the bitter reality of desolation and the events of the night.
How she had been lifted up&mdash;and the girl Gunga's laugh of triumph
and mockery rang in her ears, and was before her eyes now, as she
pressed her hands against them: the rude men who carried her down
the steps: the fearful shrieks and din in the temple: the shots and
blows, growing fainter as they carried her away: and, above all, the
voice of Moro Trimmul, exulting with Gunga that they were safe
from death, and had Tara captive. "To Rutunjun first," he had
said, "and then&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"From that worse than death he saved me," she thought, with a
shudder. "Fazil saved me&mdash;Fazil, son of Afzool&mdash;else I were helpless
with Moro now. And they were dead&mdash;her people, all dead? Yes,
the detail Fazil had related was brief and circumstantial. The
Bhópeys would not lie&mdash;why should they? They were weeping, and
had taken him up dead. Her father, a negro had killed him, they
said. She felt no hope could come out of this detail. They had
lifted him up and put him.... No, she could not follow that. That
beloved father, dead&mdash;disfigured with ghastly wounds!&mdash;mother,
whom Jánoo had seen dead, and Radha ... all? He had said so.
How could he&mdash;Fazil&mdash;know of Jánoo, or the Bhópeys, her father's
dependants, so as to deceive her with names?"</p>

<p>So, round and round, whirling, dashing hither and thither like the
motes in a sunbeam, staying nowhere, sometimes utterly blank, the
girl's thoughts ministered to her fast growing misery. The hot dry
eyes, red and swollen, looked out sometimes vacantly as the bearers
changed shoulders. She felt powerless to move, careless as to what
became of her. As the reality of the death of all, pressed on her
mind occasionally with greater force, she sat up and gasped for
breath, and again fell back upon the cushions; then the monotonous
cries of the bearers as they shuffled along rapidly, and the dull tramp
of the horses, with the sense of motion, were relief from mental
agony: and, after a time, she slept.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span></p>

<p>The action of setting down the litter, awoke her with a start.
Under some trees not far from a village gate, there was the small
hut of a Fakeer. Shêre Khan was speaking to the old man, and the
troopers were dismounting from their horses. Shêre Khan came
to her.</p>

<p>"I have sent for the Josee's wife," he said. "The Syn here says
she is a kind woman. She will bring you water and something to
eat. We rest here while the men get their breakfasts, and the
horses are fed. Fear nothing. Open the litter,&mdash;it is cool and pleasant
in the shade under the trees," and then he left her.</p>

<p>So it was. She opened the door and looked out. A small grove
of mango trees, with a smooth green sward below them, and some
cattle and goats grazing there in the cool shade; a boy and a girl
tending them looked inquisitively at her, and the girl came up shyly
and sat down by her.</p>

<p>"Do you want water, lady?" she said. "I am the Josee's
daughter, and those are my goats. I will go and tell my mother you
want water. You are a Brahmun, are you not?"</p>

<p>Tara patted her head in assent&mdash;she could not speak; and the girl
ran away, crying to the lad not to let her goats stray.</p>

<p>By-and-by the child and mother returned, and the latter brought a
copper vessel of water and a drinking-cup.</p>

<p>"Here is water, lady," she said; "will you get out and wash your
face? Surely, I know you," she continued quickly, as Tara turned
her face to her. "Where have I seen you?"</p>

<p>"No matter," said Tara, "I do not know you."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not," said the dame drearily. "So many travellers
come and go, and ... but no matter. Shall I cook anything for
you? will you come to our house and bathe?"</p>

<p>"No," said Tara; "they will go on presently; I will stay here."</p>

<p>"Come hither, Ooma," she said to the girl, who was standing
apart, and she whispered to her; "go, and come quickly," she added
aloud.</p>

<p>"Do not send for any one else," said Tara; "I am well."</p>

<p>"Are you not ill?" said the woman. "Ah, your eyes are red and
swollen."</p>

<p>"I have a headache," replied Tara; "it is so hot."</p>

<p>"Yes," said the woman, sitting down, and putting her arm kindly
round Tara, and pressing her head against her own bosom,&mdash;"yes,
you look tired and weary, but it will pass away. Wash your face and
hands, and your feet&mdash;it will do you good, and refresh you. Put out
your feet&mdash;so&mdash;I will wash them."</p>

<p>The cool water was refreshing as it was poured over her hands and
feet; and after the woman had dried them with the end of her saree,
she again laid Tara's head against her breast, and patted her as
though she were her own child.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span></p>

<p>"You look so weary," she said; "have you travelled far?"</p>

<p>"From Tooljapoor," Tara replied.</p>

<p>"Is all well there?" asked the woman. It was a common question
with no meaning to the asker, but of how much to Tara!</p>

<p>She could not answer, but clung, almost convulsively, to the kind
breast on which she had laid her head.</p>

<p>"I see," said the woman; "so young and rich, and yet thou art in
sorrow, lady&mdash;rest here." And she drew her the more closely to her,
and patted her as before. So they sat till the child came back, who
brought upon a plate, covered with a handkerchief, a few simple
sweetmeats and some parched rice. "Eat," she said, "if ever so
little; eat a bit of 'Luddoo,' and drink some water." Tara shook her
head, and only nestled the closer to the soft bosom: it was strangely
like her mother's.</p>

<p>"Poor thing, poor thing," thought the woman to herself, "what
can ail her? Perhaps her husband is unkind. Eat, my rose," she
said aloud, "eat this." And she broke off a piece of the cake and
put it to Tara's mouth. "I made it myself, and it is quite pure
and clean. Eat it; open your mouth." Tara did so mechanically, and
she put it in.</p>

<p>Tara tried to eat, but her mouth was dry and hot; she could not
swallow, and felt choking. The woman saw it, and rubbed her
throat gently. The hardness and constriction seemed to relax, and
she was able to swallow what she had taken, and to eat a little more,
the woman feeding her.</p>

<p>"Good," she said kindly, "try again by-and-by. O lady, what
heavy grief is on you that no tears come? Can I do aught for you?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," said Tara; "only do not leave me while they are
absent."</p>

<p>So they sat silently. If Tara could have wept, it had been well;
but that blessed relief was not to come yet. She was quiet, however,
sitting there, almost stupified, resting her head against the woman's
breast, who still patted her. Every now and then the great, sore, hot
eyes looked out drearily. Some of the goats and cattle browsed
under the trees, others had lain down resting in the shade. There
was no sound but a faint rustle of the breeze among the leaves, the
dim buzz of flies, and the droning song of a man, at a well in a
garden near, singing to his bullocks, and the distant plashing rush of
the water as it was emptied from the bag into the cistern.</p>

<p>And so they sat, till one by one the bearers gathered near them,
and tied up their hookas on the palankeen as before. Then the
horsemen came up, and she heard Shêre Khan asking her if she
were ready, and telling the bearers to take up the palankeen. Tara
had put the gifts she had received at the shrine under her waist-band,
and remembered them. As the palankeen was taken up she took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
them out and put them into the woman's hand, who, expecting perhaps
a few copper coins, stood looking at them in amazement.</p>

<p>"May your grief pass from you, and may God be merciful unto
you, my child," said the woman. Ere Tara could reply, a bearer
had shut the door, and the men ran on with renewed vigour.</p>

<p>Yes, the little change had refreshed her, and she again fell asleep,
mercifully: and it was evening, and the shadows were lengthening
fast, when she became aware that they approached a large town,
passed through a busy bazar crowded with people, then emerged
from it; crossed over a bridge, from which a large piece of water
was visible on the left hand, and the towers and bastions of a fort
washed by it; then the gloom of a deep-arched gateway, and light
beyond. A respectably dressed elderly woman, in Mahomedan
costume, took hold of the side of the palankeen, and ran along with
it a short distance.</p>

<p>"Stop," she cried to the bearers,&mdash;"this is the place; put it down
and go away."</p>

<p>Then Tara saw several other women advance and hold up a heavy
sheet so as to screen her as she got out, and the door was opened;
and Goolab, for she it was, speaking a rough dialect of Mahratta,
bid her come forth. As she did so, and stood there, Goolab "took
the evil off her," as was her custom;<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> and other women coming
forward with plates, on which were coriander and mustard seed,
waved them over her. Thus welcomed, Tara now stood waiting a
signal to advance; and Goolab, seeing her trembling violently, put
her arm round her, looking with wonder at the richness of her apparel
and the heavy gold ornaments she wore, her exceeding beauty causing
respect and silence even from the loquacious and privileged nurse.</p>

<p>"Enter," said a low sweet voice from within a curtain hanging
across a doorway, which was slightly opened.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_LXIII" id="CHAPTER_LXIII">CHAPTER LXIII.</a></h2>


<p>Tara advanced, still trembling, and clinging to Goolab, and trying
to hide her face in the end of her garment; she was only sensible of
the same sweet voice, as a girl of great, and to her strange, beauty,
took her in her arms, embraced her, and said gently, "Peace be
unto you! you are welcome, with the peace and blessing of Alla upon
you!" and that another taller and older lady embraced her in like
manner, and said the same. After that for a long while she remembered
nothing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span></p>
<p>When she recovered, she was lying upon a soft bedding in a small
room, near an open window which looked out upon the lake that
encircled the fort, glowing with the reflection of piles of sunset-clouds.
On what seemed an island in the lake was a Hindu temple, with a
high pyramidical roof, around which hung the rich foliage of several
magnificent trees, and temple and trees were reflected double in the
still water. These were the first objects that met her sight.</p>

<p>Then, turning round, the same young face that she had seen on
entering the apartment bent over her, and a soft warm hand was
passed over her face, and the ends of the fingers kissed in loving
greeting; but the girl did not speak, though a sweet smile spread
over her features, and she seemed to beckon with her left hand to
another person behind her, whom Tara could not see. Another
moment and her deliverer advanced, saluting her respectfully.</p>

<p>Fazil had ridden fast to overtake Tara, but had not succeeded.
Twenty men, a light palankeen, and the hope of a liberal reward,
had induced the bearers to put out their utmost speed, and they had
well redeemed their promise of reaching their destination before
sunset; but he had arrived soon after.</p>

<p>"Go away, brother," said Zyna, "do not speak to her now; you have
seen that she is safe&mdash;that is enough."</p>

<p>"My sister," he replied in Persian, that Tara might not understand,
"not so. It will grieve her, and thee too, sorely, but she must
know the truth. Do not go away. I will speak to her in her own
tongue, and show her these sad memorials which I have brought. It
is mercy not to delay in such cases.&mdash;Can you listen to me, lady, a
few moments?" he continued to Tara; "what I have to tell you is
not worse than what you have already heard, but it will confirm it;
and truth and reality are ever better than doubt."</p>

<p>"If you please to say it, sir," said Tara, who had arisen directly
she saw Fazil approaching, and stood by the window.</p>

<p>"If&mdash;if&mdash;you saw anything that had belonged to them you would
know it, perhaps," said Fazil hesitatingly.</p>

<p>Tara's bosom heaved so that she could not speak. She appeared
as if gasping for breath, with the same distressing symptoms as
when, in the morning, he had told her first of her bereavement,&mdash;and
she trembled violently. She could not stand, and crouched
down against the wall.</p>

<p>"O, not now, brother! not now," pleaded Zyna, who put her arm
round Tara, and was supporting her.</p>

<p>But Fazil was merciless. "It must be," he said. "And now,
lady, listen. If you had any doubt, these will remove it. After I
left you the second time I went to the Kuchéri, for what Jánoo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
Näik told me he had left there, and these were given as having
belonged to your mother, Anunda Bye, and your stepmother, Radha
Bye. Look at them."</p>

<p>As he spoke he untied a bundle he held, and poured the contents
at her feet; heavy gold and silver ornaments of some value, and a
few rings.</p>

<p>Tara looked at them for a moment. The silver chain anklets,
which were her mother's, were dabbled with blood, now dry on them;
the gold pair had been made after those on her own feet for Radha's
marriage, by her brother Moro. Enough&mdash;all were familiar objects.
They swam before her eyes&mdash;the room seemed whirling round, and,
weak as she was, she sank down again utterly unconscious, with
Zyna crying over her.</p>

<p>"Let them remain," said Fazil, "she must see them when she
recovers, else she will not believe. Show them to her one by one.
I dare not stay;" and he left the room.</p>

<p>Tara had not however fainted, but she was gasping for breath,
and Zyna called to Goolab to bring a fan, while she opened the
casement of the window still more, to let in air. "He said&mdash;he
said," sobbed Tara, trying to speak; "lady, I cannot speak&mdash;I am
choking&mdash;O! why do I not die? He said&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He said you were to look at them all, one by one," said Zyna,
trying to check her own sobs and tears. "He is kind. Fazil, my
brother, would not give you pain unless it were for good. Look!
here they are," and Zyna spread out the ornaments with her own
hands, shuddering at the blood upon them.</p>

<p>Tara looked earnestly at Zyna; the eyes were full of misery&mdash;so
full that Zyna could not bear them&mdash;passed her hands over her own,
pressing them tightly, then looked away. Tara turned the ornaments
vacantly over and over, sighing, and, as it were, catching her
breath convulsively. There was one, a ring with a sapphire set in
it, with which she knew her mother never parted, for she believed
that without it evil would happen to her, and that it had brought
prosperity. It used sometimes to be put on the altar when they
worshipped Lakshmee, the Goddess of Wealth&mdash;else it never left her
mother's hand; but it was there. Zyna did not know this then,
but she saw Tara's hand tremble very much as she took it up and
looked at it carefully. There was a dark stain inside, and Tara put
down the ring, gasping, as it were, for breath, then took it up again.</p>

<p>Zyna watched wonderingly, the changing expressions which passed
over the beautiful features: first despair; then, as it seemed to her,
prayers were murmured in a language she did not understand, and
the features appeared to relax, the upturned eyes glistened, there
was a look as if of hope or triumph upon the face. She moved
closer to Tara, still closer, as she thought she saw tears gathering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
in the hot eyes. If Tara could only weep it would be well. Zyna
passed her left arm round her, and gently drew the girl's head on
er own shoulder and bosom; it fell softly there and rested; the
hand which held the ring dropped on her lap, beating restlessly;
but the other grasped her so that it almost caused pain. Kind
nature did not suffer the terrible struggle to continue longer, else
Tara had died; and with almost a shriek of pain, her tears burst
forth uncontrollably.</p>

<p>"Thank God for it," said Lurlee, who had entered, and was standing
over them, and who now passed her hands over Tara, as Goolab
had done; "she will be easier for this, and the worst is past: let
her weep. The blessing of Alla and the Prophet on thee, my
daughter," she said to Tara. "I salute thee with peace! Thou
hast entered at a fortunate moment, and there is joy following thy
grief. Fear not; thou hast come to those who will be to thee what
thou hast lost."</p>

<p>"She will require much care, mother," said Zyna; "feel how she
is trembling; I will not leave her. Ah, yes&mdash;that is the reason;
take away those things, Goolab; wash them and put them by."</p>

<p>Goolab took them up, and with all her choicest epithets of "Poor
little rose! my pretty dove! my lily! my own life!" she tried to
soothe the girl; but Tara heeded no one. Keeping the ring clutched
in her own hand, she hid her face in Zyna's bosom, then suffered
her gradually to lay her head down on her knee, and rock it softly.
She dared not speak, but tried to look up gratefully, sometimes, and
then clung the closer to her gentle nurse.</p>

<p>"Hush," said Zyna, as fresh bursts of tears often occurred, "I
know what has happened, and I will not leave thee, Tara; no,
never now. And he, my brother, says it too." So they sat and lay&mdash;the
two girls&mdash;long into the night; and gradually, unable to resist
the kindness lavished on her, Tara spoke a little, and Zyna encouraged
it, and heard wonderingly, Tara's simple tale of trial and
sorrow.</p>

<p>That night, too, her future fate was the subject of earnest debate,
often approaching the verge of passion, between Afzool Khan, his
son, and the priest. What could they do with a Brahmun orphan,
a heathen unbeliever who was a captive, and a slave, by the laws of
war? Long and earnestly did the priest plead that she should forthwith
be sent to the royal harem. So beautiful a slave would be
cherished, loved, and have every luxury at her command; she might
become the mother of princes, and the head of the state; and Afzool
Khan supported this opinion, which was borne out by texts from the
law, plausibly quoted by the Peer.</p>

<p>But Fazil opposed them both, gently yet firmly, and at last almost
fiercely. "She is my captive, if captive at all," he said; "my slave,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
taken in war, according to your own texts, Huzrut&mdash;and I can release
her, or ransom her, or keep her, as I will. She has relatives at Wye,
where we are going, and with your permission, father, she can stay
with us till then; we will be her safeguard, honourably and truly.
After that," he added with some little confusion, "she can act for
herself, and of her own free will; but to send her to the palace, to
be decked out and noticed for a while, and then flung aside&mdash;no,
father; better she died, or better still that we now turned her into
the street, to shift for herself among her own people."</p>

<p>"That would be inhospitable, son, if no more," returned his father;
"well, boy, let her stay, and welcome. No matter," he thought to
himself, "if he have his own way in this thing." The Khan was
decidedly in good humour. The kichéri, kabobs, and some other
dishes which were especial favourites, had been dressed to perfection
by Lurlee, and were relished, as they can best be, with the zest
insured by a long ride.</p>

<p>Lurlee had met him in good humour, and the stars were in propitious
conjunction to welcome his arrival. The lady had nothing
but good to say of Tara, whose beauty and sad history had at once
deeply impressed her. "What if she be an infidel," she said, "she
will make the better true believer. Let her stay with us, O Khan!
she shall be a daughter to me," and the lady sighed. "There is
nothing unlucky about the period of her arrival, for the sun was in
conjunction with Jupiter, and she was born under Venus, she says;
and as she is a Brahmun she knows all about her horoscope and the
planets; besides, is not this Wednesday, and she arrived between
five and six in the evening, under Venus, so that she is born to us
under the same planet as she was born to her own parents? Is not
that curious? and by-and-by I shall call her Fazila, according to the
blessed scheme of nativity sent by the prophets. And listen further,
Khan," continued the lady, pausing and examining her book. "Her
name now begins with a T, and that stands for Air, and is lucky,
because&mdash;&mdash;" and she was nearly saying it aloud, only she checked
herself in time, "because," she said to herself, "Fazil's name begins
with an F, and that means Fire, and fire and air always agree best,
because the one cannot exist apart from the other."</p>

<p>"I don't understand, Lurlee," said the Khan, "how it is. What
about fire?"</p>

<p>"Never mind," replied the lady knowingly, "you will find out
more by-and-by, Khan! there is a good deal to be done before
then."</p>

<p>So Tara escaped another great peril which she knew not of, and
remained as an honoured and welcome guest with her new protectors.
And in a few days, when Afzool Khan had made the necessary
arrangements, his army was ready to move on. These need no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
detail at our hands, except as concerns two characters in our history
who did not accompany it.</p>

<p>The first was Kowas Khan, who, recalled by the King to manage
the affairs of his own troops, returned from Sholapoor to the capital.
The young man regretted the necessity; for to share a campaign in
real service with his friend Fazil, had ever been one of his most
cherished plans. The King's order was, however, peremptory, and
was obeyed. "When we return," said the old Khan to him as they
parted, "the days of mourning will be expired, and thou shalt have
thy desire."</p>

<p>With him was sent the Lalla, who, being naturally of an unwarlike
nature, rejoiced at the prospect of escaping hardships of no ordinary
kind. And was not Kowas Khan the late Wuzeer's son, and nominal
Wuzeer himself? He might become actually so, and what a field
for advancement was opened to him if this should be! "May your
prosperity increase, may you be victorious," he said to the father and
son as he took leave of them. "Inshalla! your poor servant will
write you news of the city and court, after the true imperial fashion,
which is more his vocation than recording battles; only remember
that your slave is grateful."</p>

<p>Afzool Khan's army, now organized in all respects, set forward on
its march. A few miles only were traversed daily, and it would
require a month or more ere they could reach Wye. Sometimes a
house was found for the ladies in a village or town near which the
forces encamped; but more frequently they were in the Khan's
tents, which were infinitely pleasanter. The two girls grew together,
the more as the first restraint passed away; and the lady Lurlee and
Zyna were never tired of hearing from the lips of the beautiful
heathen, the simple story of her life, her widowhood, and her
strange rescue from dishonour.</p>

<p>Was Tara happy? Yes; when she thought of what her fate
must have been had she not been rescued from Moro Trimmul, or
even if Fazil had yielded to her first entreaties, and let her go without
inquiry. She knew not then of the further escape from the
royal harem which Fazil had secured; but as it was, gratitude to
him had already become the main feeling of her life. Of her parents'
death she had no doubt whatever now. The other members of the
family would have claimed the property and cast her off. Widow
and priestess combined, she would have been helpless against the
insult and profligacy of men of her own faith, and now she was at
least safe. She was grateful, therefore, and, for the most part,
happy too.</p>

<p>But often, as she wept bitterly under the old memories of an
innocent and happy home, the loving arms of her mother seemed
clasped about her once more, and her caresses almost palpably felt,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
while the glistening eyes of the goddess appeared to follow her,
sleeping and waking, with a reproachful look of desertion. In these
moments, Tara endured bitter grief; but ever at hand were the
gentle remonstrances of her new mother and sister, and to them also
were joined those of her deliverer which, in the constant association
which grew out of a camp life, she felt becoming more and more
powerful day by day.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_LXIV" id="CHAPTER_LXIV">CHAPTER LXIV.</a></h2>


<p>Among the events which passed at Sholapoor after the arrival of the
Khan, was the disposition of the prisoner Moro Trimmul. Heavily
ironed and closely guarded, he had been brought from Tooljapoor on
horseback, his irons loosened from one leg, and, when they were
again riveted, he was consigned to the custody of the Khan's own
troop. When the fate of the Brahmun hung in a balance, and Fazil,
fearing him, and knowing his indefatigable and successful attempts
in propagating the political influence of the Mahrattas, had at first
urged his execution, then his transmission to Beejapoor,&mdash;there was
not a dissentient voice in the small council; but at Sholapoor the
aspect of affairs had changed: the priest and his father had sent for
Moro Trimmul, and examined him in private; and the sullenness of
the man had apparently broken down before the threats of being
despatched to Beejapoor, and submitted to his fate with the King.</p>

<p>The Khan and the priest were no believers in the honesty of
Mahrattas; and at the second of these examinations, the Brahmun
was plied with temptation such as was difficult to resist, and to which
he yielded with apparent reluctance, but yielded nevertheless. To
assist them in speaking with the prisoner (for though the priest
spoke Mahratta perfectly well, yet, as a language of infidels, rarely
suffered it, as he said, to defile his mouth; and if he did, subjected
that organ to an excessive purification at the hour of prayer),&mdash;a
Brahmun, who belonged to the accountant's department of the
state, by name Punto Gopináth, was employed by the Khan. Of
this man he knew but little: but he was a good Persian scholar, as
well as an intelligent official servant of the kingdom, and the Khan
had no doubt of his fidelity.</p>

<p>Nor, indeed, Bulwunt Rao either; who, a bad interpreter himself,
had, on all occasions, been allowed to be present, as a check
upon the Brahmuns. Both had joined in trying to persuade Moro
Trimmul to disclose the intentions of his master, and had always
been met with the same answer, that the Prince only desired recognition
of his rights, and that when he heard for certain of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
march of the force, he would be sure to send ambassadors to explain
what had occurred. So it had come to this, that if ambassadors did
arrive within a few days, Moro Trimmul was to be confronted with
them; otherwise, that he was to be sent back to Beejapoor, to be
dealt with as a traitor.</p>

<p>To Bulwunt Rao, whose Mahratta mind was capable of understanding
and appreciating an indirect motive of policy, the Khan's
determination seemed perfectly reasonable; and if Moro Trimmul
could by any means be brought to consent to lead the force through
the defiles beyond Wye, some effect upon the Rajah's position might
be obtained. If not, who was to do it?</p>

<p>To Fazil, however, the position taken up by his father was so
unintelligible, and so unlike his usual straightforward mode of
proceeding, that he feared some extraneous agency was at work. It
was not so, however: it was simply the power which strong minds
exercise over weaker; and by the Brahmun's cool contempt of death,
his certainty that Sivaji would beg for terms, and his willingness to
assist if he did,&mdash;the Khan's suspicions were overcome.</p>

<p>Nor was it strange, perhaps, that after a time the Khan appeared
to attach no particular culpability to Moro Trimmul's attempt to
carry off Tara. He had explained the act, by her father having tired
of her presence in the house as the jealous enemy of his sister, a new
and beautiful wife, and had requested him to take her away to Wye,
to devote her to one of the temples there. Some little force was, no
doubt, necessary; but her father had authorized its being used, to
prevent interference by her mother. What did he care about the
girl?&mdash;as a widow she was impure, and her not having performed
the rites of widowhood, placed her beyond the pale of respectability;
yes, the Khan might make a Mahomedan of her, send her to the
King, or do what he pleased with his slave, he had no concern for
her now.</p>

<p>The Khan thought this state of the case on the whole more
probable, in all its aspects, than Tara's own story, heard through Lurlee
and Zyna. It did not affect her character, which Moro Trimmul
spared no words to commend.</p>

<p>So the Brahmun grew into favour; and as he did so, the flattery
which he distributed to the Khan and the priest had its effect, in
procuring him liberty, first from his irons, and then of speech with
Gopináth and other persons of his own sect, who came to converse
with one so well known by reputation. The position of all parties
continued thus till a few days after the force had left Sholapoor;
when, one morning, as the Khan reached the halting-place for the
day, the arrival of envoys from the Rajah Sivaji was announced in
camp, and without delay they were summoned to the Khan's presence.</p>

<p>We need not follow the negotiations which ensued; we have only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
to do with those who took part in them. Most of us know, too, what
Eastern negotiations are, when weakness is covered by temporizing
expedients of falsehood or treachery. So it has been from the first,
so it will be to the end. Moro Trimmul had well guessed what his
master's policy would be when he laid his fate upon the result; and
when he heard from Bulwunt Rao that the envoys had proffered
submission, and begged of Afzool Khan to advance and partake of
the Rajah's hospitality at Pertâbgurh, where the affairs pending in
dispute could be amicably discussed, he was satisfied&mdash;he could
understand what was to come.</p>

<p>His own liberation soon followed. Of what use was it confining
an irresponsible agent, when real ambassadors had voluntarily met
the Khan, and declared their master's intention to throw himself on
the royal clemency? So Moro Trimmul was set free.</p>

<p>His first act was to seek Gunga. So long as he had been kept within
the fort at Sholapoor he had heard nothing of her; but the day the
force marched, he had seen her, attended by two stout footmen with
sword and buckler, riding among the camp followers, as the division
of horsemen, under whose charge he was placed, rapidly passed a
crowd of them straggling onwards. She had not observed him, he
thought, for she made no sign of recognition. It had been otherwise,
however; and we must retrace a little this girl's proceedings, in
order to comprehend her present position.</p>

<p>Under that strange fascination which often impels women to
endure more from men who ill-use them than from those who caress
them, she had been unable to remain at Tooljapoor, and after a brief
struggle she had yielded to her destiny. When the Khan discharged
her, and the temporary insensibility of Lukshmun had procured her
the gold zone, which was valuable, the hard, mercenary nature which
had grown out of her vocation, rose as a wall between her and Moro
Trimmul, and yet but for a moment.</p>

<p>It said to her, "You have got all you can from this man, his fate
is evil; you have had many escapes from him, and this is the last. Go!
leave him, you could not save his life if you would; the Mussulmans
hate him, and will destroy him, or imprison him for life. Enough
that you have escaped; go, and be thankful." This was what she
thought, as she picked up the zone when it rolled away, fastened it
round her waist, and walked out of the room. Where was she to
go? She dared not visit the temple. Dead bodies were still lying
there, and there was blood about the streets. She went to Anunda's
house, and looked into all the courts. She saw the dead negro lying
among the flowers, and, horrified at the sight, she started back; and
just as some men opened a door and tried to intercept her, she fled
away in terror. She dared not trust herself in the quiet parts of the
town nor in the camp; for there were many who would have thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
little of a stab with a dagger, or open violence, to rid her of the zone
and the valuable ornaments she had about her. The bazar, however,
was safe, and she might meet some one she knew, and obtain
protection.</p>

<p>There were many. Among them Jánoo the Ramoosee, now very
tipsy, yet able to recognize her. He knew she was no friend of
Anunda's or Tara's, and to her he told the same story as he had done
to Fazil. "Dead, all dead!" he cried, as he staggered away&mdash;"dishonoured
and murdered by the negroes; and they are buried in the
hole beyond the well, without the gate. Go and see&mdash;go and see."</p>

<p>She went up through the gate idly, and sat down beside the great
well. She dared not go beyond it. A large peepul tree hung over
it, and a number of Hindu soldiers were cooking under its shade.
She asked for a few hot cakes, and they gave them, and she ate them
there. Then she wandered into the fields and gardens beyond, and
so round to the Pâp-nâs temple, and sat down on the ledge of rock
above the little stream, which thence leapt plashing down the precipice,
looking over the broad plain, over which the light shadows of
fleecy clouds were chasing each other.</p>

<p>Her eyes filled with tears, for there came back to her, hard and
depraved as she was, many tender memories of the man whom she
had loved passionately;&mdash;feared, hated with bitter jealousy, and
again loved with that perversity which is part of the fiercest jealousy,
and distorts every semblance of truth to serve its own purpose. The
scene of Tara's inauguration came back to her memory, and her
beauty. "It was not his fault, Mother," she cried out aloud; "it was
thine, to send that lotos-faced girl to bewitch him, else he had been
true to me, and thou art rightly served for it. He said thou wast a
fiend, and feared thee not; nor do I."</p>

<p>Yes, Tara was gone; would the Mussulman boy, so grand, so
beautiful, ever give up so lovely a captive? Surely not. "Let him
have her," she said: "she will go away, far, far from me and him,
and it is well. Yes, it is well, and what have I to do but follow and
watch,&mdash;follow and watch?"</p>

<p>Then she rose, remembering her store of money in a pot under
the fireplace, in a cloister of the temple, where she had lived. Her
clothes, her property, would be gone; what matter, if that were safe?</p>

<p>So she rose up and ran lightly along the plain, back to the gate,
avoiding the new graves; then passed down the bazar and into the
temple court. All the dead had been removed. The scavengers were
washing the court, which she crossed rapidly. As she expected, her
room had been plundered, all her clothes were gone, but the fireplace
had not been disturbed. She closed the door carefully, then sat
down for a while with a beating heart, to see whether she were
followed or not; no one came,&mdash;no one had cared to stop her, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
she had been seen. With a small iron bar which lay in a corner, she
hastily dug up the clay plastering of the hearth, and took out the
brass vessel she had hidden there, which contained her savings; there
were upwards of a hundred rupees in it&mdash;wealth to her.</p>

<p>Tying these coins carefully into her waist-band, she again went out
into the court, and proceeded to the temple. "Do not go there,"
cried a man sweeping; "it is not washed." But she went on.</p>

<p>It was not washed, and was ghastly with dried and clotted blood.
She looked into the shrine, to see what had become of the image,
venerated, feared, and yet even detested. It lay there as it had fallen.
No one had yet dared to touch it, and the wicked eyes still glistened
and sparkled in the light of the lamp which had been placed beside
it. "Aha!" cried the girl exultingly; "lie there, liar and murdering
devil, as he called thee. He did not fear thee, nor do I. Lie
there, till they pick thee up; or why dost thou not rise thyself? Up,
Mother, up! shall I help thee?" she cried mockingly, as she seized
the stone hand; but she dropped it as instantly&mdash;it was wet and cold.</p>

<p>As she did so, she fancied the eyes turned spitefully towards her,
and a horrible superstitious terror came into her heart when she
looked at her hand and saw it was covered with blood. Then she
shrieked and fled shuddering, out of the front entrance to the vestibule,
across the court, up the steps, staying only for a moment to
wash hurriedly in the sacred cistern. Thus she went into the bazar,
and sought out a carrier who she knew possessed a strong pony, who
agreed to take her to Sholapoor; and, purchasing a heavy, coarse
cotton sheet, she wrapped herself in it, and, mingling with the crowd
of camp-followers, rode after the force to Sholapoor.</p>

<p>For many days she could get no speech of Moro Trimmul. She
had seen him taken to rivulets and wells to bathe, and he had also
seen her; but though she daily tried, on one pretence or other, to
get near him, she was repulsed. It was enough, however, that she
knew where he was.</p>

<p>It was not long after his release ere he discovered her. She did
not importune him, and he could hardly resist the devotion which
had prompted her to abandon what had been her home and follow
his fortunes. He trusted also to induce her, gradually, again to
further his designs against Tara, which, now that her parents, and,
as he believed, also his own sister, were all dead, appeared more
probable of success than before.</p>

<p>If ever this selfish man had felt a pang of real grief in his life, it
was when he had heard of his sister's death. Poor Radha! whom he
had settled at last so well, when any provision for her had become
next to hopeless&mdash;Radha, who, with all her faults, was part of his
own rugged nature, polished and set in a more beautiful frame. It
was impossible not to grieve for her. This was the first impression;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
afterwards there ensued an element of rejoicing in it, which daily
grew stronger. That he was free&mdash;free to act: free from the keen
perception and daring opposition of his sister, which, ever protecting
Tara as with a shield, had only yielded to violence at the last.</p>

<p>Now Tara was within his reach, and, comparatively speaking, in a
far greater measure than before. He knew her to be safe in the
family with whom she had obtained protection. Their own high
honour and strict respectability were guarantee for this. Knowing
her helplessness, Moro Trimmul had but one source of alarm or
apprehension: she might allow herself to be converted to the Mahomedan
faith, or it might be done without her consent. Then, indeed,
there would be no hope.</p>

<p>But, on the other hand, was she not a Brahmun&mdash;wonderfully
learned for a woman, proud of this learning, and, above all, a self-professed
devotee of the goddess?</p>

<p>"No," he thought, "they may attempt conversion, probably will
do so, but she will resist it: and yet she should not be too long
exposed to a double temptation." Now, therefore, as before, he
discussed plans with Gunga as to what means could be employed to
separate Tara from her new protectors, and carry her away into the
wilds of his native province, where she could be effectually concealed;
and his pursuit of the girl grew once more into a fierce and morbid
passion, absorbing and deadening all other feelings of his life.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_LXV" id="CHAPTER_LXV">CHAPTER LXV.</a></h2>


<p>"The gods be praised!" cried Jeyram Bhópey to Wamun Bhut, late
in the day after the attack upon the temple. "He has opened his
eyes once more. Speak, Vyas Shastree; you are safe amongst
friends: the gods be praised, and Toolja Máta, for this mercy, for we
little expected to see you live."</p>

<p>"Who are you?" said the Shastree faintly. "I see very dimly,
and it appears very dark.&mdash;Anunda! Tara!&mdash;--"</p>

<p>"I, Wamun, speak to you," replied the elder of the two priests,
"and this is Jeyram Bhópey. We carried you away, and you are
safe in the house of Gunnésh Hurry, Putwari of Sindphul.&mdash;Look,
friends," he continued, speaking to others without the door of the
room, "the Shastree is alive, and hath spoken, and asked for his wife
and daughter."</p>

<p>Vyas Shastree was sensible that the room darkened again, as a
number of men crowded to the door; but, feeling sick and faint from
the exertion of speaking even those few words, thought himself
dying, and relapsed again into insensibility.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span></p>

<p>Very anxiously did all those friends watch around the wounded
man; and it was long before he showed any appearance of rallying
strength. Night passed, and they hardly expected he would see the
day; but still he breathed, and as morning was breaking, a warm
moisture took the place of the chill, clammy, deathlike state in which
he had remained previously, and then those attending him hoped
that he would live.</p>

<p>He had received a fearful wound. Bareheaded as he was in the
performance of the ceremonies so rudely interrupted, he had not
thought of protecting himself; but, as the Abyssinians advanced, had
caught a sword and shield offered him by a man in the crowd, who
drew back and fled, and had passed to the front with some others,
crying the shout of the goddess, "Jey Kalee!" "Jey Toolja!" and
catching blows on the shield rather than returning them. But when
a gigantic negro before him was pressing upon the front rank of
those who defended the entrance to the vestibule, so heavily that it
seemed as if they must give way, the old soldier spirit within the
Shastree was stirred, and he struck desperately at the man. Stung
by the pain of the wound, the negro instantly returned the blow with
a furious cut, which laid open the crown of the Shastree's head from
back to front. Well for him that the shield had greatly broken the
force of it, or he had died instantly; as it was, the Shastree fell
stunned, and was trampled upon by the advancing crowd; and lay
there, unconscious, until the early morning.</p>

<p>Then the two friends who had watch him fall, and who, concealed
in the recess behind the shrine, had escaped slaughter, came forth
and sought for him. They found him under a pile of dead, still
breathing, but utterly insensible. It was impossible to take him to
his own house, for the gateway and bazar were filled with Abyssinians,
and they feared a renewal of slaughter with the dawn; so
they lifted the Shastree from the ground, obtained a bedstead from
one of the closed archway rooms, put him upon it, and, being joined
by several of the Bhópey priests, had broken open the postern by
which Tara had been taken away, and carried him at once, unobserved,
to Sindphul.</p>

<p>Had Tara remained where she had been first stopped, she must
have seen her father borne past her, and would have been saved; but
Fazil Khan had sent her palankeen to the trees by the back of the
rivulet, about a gunshot's distance from the path, out of sight; and
though those who carried the Shastree were challenged by Shêre
Khan's horsemen, there was nothing suspicious in the fact of a dead
body, for so it seemed, being carried away,&mdash;and the little procession
had passed unnoticed.</p>

<p>Heera, the barber of Sindphul, was a skilful surgeon, and on his
arrival at the house of the Putwari or accountant of the village, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
Shastree's wound was examined. The barber had seldom seen
worse, and during the time which had elapsed since he had received
it, the Shastree had become weak from loss of blood. So Heera
shook his head. Still he did his best: the wound was sewn up skilfully,
and a composing poultice of warm leaves and herbs applied to
it, while the bruised body was fomented. All night had Heera
watched anxiously with the friends about the Shastree, fearing the
worst, for he was restless and feverish; but with the morning came
refreshing sleep, and the warm moist skin for which the barber had
so anxiously looked. Then he said, "If the gods please, the
Shastree will live. Let him be kept quiet, and the room darkened."</p>

<p>At first the women of his family were hardly missed. All those
who could escape had fled into the fields and gardens around little
Tooljapoor, and many into the deep ravine beyond the town, or to
adjacent villages. Sindphul was crowded with them, and no one
dare return till the Mahomedan force had passed.</p>

<p>The Bhóslay of Sindphul had searched again and again through
his village and its hamlets for the Shastree's wives and for Tara, but
in vain. He had sent men to look for them in their own house, but
they were not there. The place showed the signs of violence we
already know of; and the men in charge of it could only hope that
Jánoo Näik might account for them.</p>

<p>Jánoo had been sought, therefore, and found in the liquor-seller's
shop drinking out his money; and when asked for Anunda and
Tara, said, with drunken solemnity, that he had buried them all.
The idea had possessed him that this was the safest answer for all
questioners, and he held to it the more pertinaciously as his drunkenness
increased. It was impossible not to fear that the story might
be true; for all had seen Tara in the throng of priests and priestesses,
and knew also that Anunda and Radha had been in the temple.</p>

<p>We left them crouching in a niche, as it were, of the rock,
overgrown by long pendant creepers and grass, near the little spring,
and there they passed the night. At early dawn Jánoo had come to
them with his son, and told them that their house had been attacked
in the night, and was no safe place for them. It was polluted,
moreover, and they could not return to it. That Tara and the Shastree
had escaped to Sindphul; that he dare not take them past the
force which was guarding the town and pass, and that they must go
to Afsinga, where all was quiet. He knew they had friends in a
Brahmun's family which resided there, and thither Anunda and
Radha suffered themselves to be guided by the boy, while Jánoo,
after seeing them safe across the hill, returned to his post.</p>

<p>Weeping bitterly, hardly knowing whether to go on with the lad
or to return, at all risks, to Tooljapoor, the two women had yielded
to Jánoo's well-intended but mistaken direction. The path was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
stony and rough, and their naked feet, unused to such places, were
sorely bruised and cut in descending the rugged track by which,
through the most intricate and gloomy ravines of the hills, they were
guided. It was hardly four miles, perhaps, and yet, faint and
wretched as they were, the sun was high in the heavens ere they
reached their destination, and were kindly received.</p>

<p>They told their story; but what could be done? Who could go to
Tooljapoor? The Brahmun to whose house they had betaken themselves
was old and feeble, but a student who lived with him, and who
had been absent since daylight to obtain information, returned about
noon. He had no news of the Shastree or of Tara; but he volunteered
to go again to seek them, and did so, returning at night with
accounts of a fruitless search. Jánoo, he said, knew nothing of them,
and he had found him telling the same story, that he had buried
Anunda and Radha out of sight,&mdash;and understood&mdash;what the faithful
but drunken creature had perhaps meant to convey to all inquirers&mdash;that
they were safely hidden away.</p>

<p>Perhaps Jánoo would not have been absent so long had he been
sober; but the excitement and his potations together had been too
much for him. When he awoke, having lain down to sleep in the
bazar, it was evening, and they were lighting the lamps in the shops.
"It is too late now," thought he, "to go across the hills for the
Shastree's wives, and they are safer where they are;" so he betook
himself to the house. His men were there in charge. The dead
negro had been taken out and buried, and some of the blood washed
away; but the place was utterly defiled: the sacred fire had gone out,
and the whole premises must undergo purification ere they could
enter or inhabit it once more. Jánoo shrugged his shoulders&mdash;"They
cannot live here," he said; "there is the hut in the garden at Sindphul,
and I will take them there and hide them in it."</p>

<p>So in the morning, before it was light, he set out from Tooljapoor,
and crossed the hills, with two of his men leading two stout ponies
for the women, and reached Afsinga before the sun had risen. He
brought no tidings of the Shastree; but it was reported generally in
the town, he said, that he and Tara were at Sindphul; and, in any
case, they must go there and live in the garden till the house could
be purified, and fit to be again inhabited. This was scant comfort
to Anunda and Radha; but Jánoo said that most families in the town
were in the same predicament, that he knew the Shastree and Tara
were not among the dead, and probability confirmed the report that
they had fled in the confusion, and were safe.</p>

<p>It was hardly four miles to Sindphul by the road at the foot of the
hills on the plain; and they set out, after their hospitable hosts had
insisted upon their taking an early meal. Anunda would fain have
gone by Tooljapoor, but Jánoo overruled it. There was no one there;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
they would only sit down and cry at the house door; and if the
Shastree were at Sindphul, they would be delayed going to him.
Nobody had been disturbed there; and the Bhóslay and the Putwari
would advise them for the best in any case.</p>

<p>All these arguments overruled Anunda, and they set out with their
guide. They met no one, except a few men watching in their fields
by the wayside, who told them all was quiet. Jánoo would not even
take them near the pass of Tooljapoor, but, striking across the plain
by the Gosai's Mutt, and through the great mango grove, they
reached Sindphul unobserved.</p>

<p>It is not a large village, and they were well known there. Passing
up the central street, they had greetings from many friends, both
men and women. At last they saw their own old gardener sitting
weeping at the door of the Putwari's house; and Jánoo, who was
leading Anunda's pony, took them thither. They were both sick at
heart as they dismounted and entered. The Putwari's wife and his
married daughter who lived in the house were kind people, and met
them in the outer court. "He is alive," said the dame; "fear not.
Heera has dressed the wound, and he has spoken to my husband, and
asked for you. We told him we had sent for you, and that you were
coming, and, behold, the gods have brought you." Then she led
Anunda, weeping, into the inner court, and Radha followed. The
men sitting about the door of the apartment got up, and, feeling they
had no more to do, went out, all but the old Putwari.</p>

<p>"Vyas Shastree," he said, as the women approached the door, "be
comforted; they are safe, and have come to you. Be gentle with
him," he added to Anunda; "he is very weak, and Heera says if he
is made anxious, or disturbed, fever may come on; therefore, be
careful."</p>

<p>It was well meant to give them caution, but at such moments,
nature will have its course. The women had existed&mdash;since the
attack on the temple, and since they had fled with Jánoo&mdash;in a state
of intense fear and misery which cannot be described; and yet one
mercy had accompanied this dread, that they had not fully known
what had happened in the temple, and so hope had sustained them.
Now, however, there was no doubt; and in a paroxysm of mingled
fear and thankfulness, they cast themselves beside the low bed,
embracing their husband's feet, and weeping passionately. The
Shastree was too weak to speak or move; he could only lift up his
hand gently, as if to bless them and welcome them, while a faint
but grateful smile spread itself over his pallid features.</p>

<p>For a little time, and as they sat silently beside him ministering
to their wants&mdash;for Anunda was an unrivalled nurse, and had at
once proceeded to arrange many things about him, as he liked&mdash;strange
to say, they did not miss Tara; but Anunda's mind suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
misgave her. Her husband, whom her arrival had aroused,
had again fallen into a doze, and she went outside to ask for her.
The whole court had been left to them, and the door of the outer
one was closed. "Tara," she called gently, several times, but there
was no reply. She might be asleep, she thought, in one of the
rooms which opened into it, and she searched in each in succession.
There was no one. Radha joined her. "Where is Tara?" she
said. "She should have been with him." True, she should have
been with her father, but she was not.</p>

<p>The women turned sick at heart and sat down. A nameless
terror seized them, so absorbing, that they could say nothing, but
that she was not. Anunda dare not ask. Of the two, Radha was
most self-possessed. Looking through the door, she saw the old
Putwari's wife sitting outside it, and as if watching the place. She
called her in, and the dame saw at a glance what was needed. O
the misery of that mother's face! who, after trying to articulate
"Tara," which her lips formed, as though she spoke the word, fell
forward clasping the knees and feet of her old friend, and groaning
in her despair.</p>

<p>"The gods have given thee one precious object, sister, and taken
the other," she said. "Be thankful for what is spared thee."</p>

<p>Then Anunda thought Tara was dead, and so did Radha; but
the woman resumed&mdash;</p>

<p>"And yet, why should I say so, Anunda? We know not; she
has not been heard of. Let us wait. Hundreds of our friends fled
from the temple and from the town. Many we sheltered here all
yesterday till the force passed by; then they returned home. So
Tara may be at some village near, and we have men watching at
your house and at the temple. The Bhópeys will send intelligence
if they get any."</p>

<p>"She is not in the garden?" asked Radha.</p>

<p>"No; we searched there long ago, and in all the gardens. No,
she is not here, and you must wait. She was favoured of the
Mother, sister, and will not be deserted. At least we know she was
not killed."</p>

<p>Anunda was comforted for the moment by this, and the women
went and resumed their watch by their husband. It was a relief,
perhaps, not to speak&mdash;a relief, too, to find, in watching him and
ministering to his wants, a diversion from the other care. Sooner
or later Tara might come in. Jánoo had at once gone in search of
her; the Bhópeys had despatched horsemen to every village around,
and there would surely be news of her before nightfall.</p>

<p>But none came that night, nor the next day. The Shastree was
not yet aware of Tara's absence; fever had begun&mdash;the fever of the
wound&mdash;and he was unconscious of most things. Sometimes he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
recognized Anunda, and sometimes called Radha, Tara. It was a
blessed thing then that he knew no more. Neither of the women
relaxed for a moment in their work, and sat there by the bed, without
sleep and without rest, looking for news of Tara; but none came.
Messenger after messenger arrived, but with no tidings of her.</p>

<p>Late next day Jánoo returned. He must see Anunda, he said; he
had news of importance about Tara, and, so far as he knew, she was
not dead.</p>

<p>Anunda went to the man outside; he might not enter because of
his impure caste.</p>

<p>Jánoo was a man of few words and scant ceremony, and he blurted
out, "Moro Trimmul and Gunga took her away, lady. I was drinking
last night with some of our people, who are strangers, and came
from a distance, and who were dividing booty: and they said they
had carried off a beautiful Moorlee as the disturbance broke out,
and put her in a palankeen, and they were paid by Moro Trimmul,
the reciter. They treated me and some of my people to liquor, and
told us of this as a good piece of business. And I have not stolen
them, lady; but the jewels you gave me are gone; they were given
to Pahar Singh's hunchback, who came and asked for them in the
Kuchéri in my name: but Pahar Singh will give them up; or if
not, I will burn a corn-stack of his every night till he does."</p>

<p>All this was told rapidly and confusedly. The detail was hardly
intelligible; but one great fact came out beyond all others, and if it
were true, better Tara were dead&mdash;O, far better!</p>

<p>"Wait," said Anunda, "and I will come to thee again;" and
she went in and whispered it all to Radha. She saw the girl's face
flush and her bosom heave rapidly. "Gunga must have helped
him," she said, "else he had not dared it, and I will see to it myself."
So they both went out to the Ramoosee, and Radha at once
declared she would go with him to the town above, and make
inquiries.</p>

<p>She was shrewd and active. Accompanied by Jánoo and two of
the Bhóslay's retainers, she soon found the man from whom Jánoo
had heard of Tara, and listened to his story. They had known
nothing of Moro Trimmul's purpose, he said, till that night of the
recitation, or how the girl they took was to be decoyed away, or who
she was; but as the disturbance began, she was brought out by him
in his arms, and then they took her. Yes, he knew what had become
of her. Moro Trimmul had been put in irons by the Mahomedan
chief, and Tara had been carried off to Sholapoor. He and his
companions had watched the palankeen from the rocks in the ravine
where they had hidden themselves, because, if it had been left unguarded,
they would have gone to it.</p>

<p>It was clear enough now, therefore, that Tara was gone, not dead.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
That would have been grief&mdash;bitter grief; but here was more misery
than death would have caused. Who had taken their Tara? for
what fate was she reserved? They could only think of her beauty
as destined for some Mahomedan harem&mdash;reserved for a fate worse
than death.</p>

<p>It was piteous to see the mother and the sister-wife prostrated
under this misery and the state of their husband; and it was with
difficulty that Radha was restrained from going at once to Sholapoor
after the camp, and endeavouring to trace and reclaim Tara. If she
had only done so&mdash;if this energetic girl, used to rough ways and
rapid journeys, had been allowed to follow out her own plans, what
misery might not have been saved to all! Hard she pleaded, that
she could not be denied to her brother. She would force from him
an account of Tara, and would bring her back.</p>

<p>But Anunda hesitated; and the Shastree, to whom all was told,
weak as he was in body, was more than usually vacillating. The
Mahomedan camp, full of licentiousness, was no place for a Brahmun
girl. "The Shastree must be attended," Anunda said; and, in
Tara's absence, he seemed to cling the more fondly to his young
wife, and to miss her ministrations if even she was temporarily
absent. Finally, the matter was left in the hands of their friends,
the Bhóslay and the old Putwari, and they decided that Radha
must not go; but a messenger should be sent, who, assisted by
friends and Brahmuns at Sholapoor, would do all that was needful
or possible.</p>

<p>In truth, all these friends thought that seeking for Tara at all
was injudicious. They could not believe, considering her beauty
and public vocation as a priestess, that she could have escaped observation,
and they had come to the conclusion that her preservation
from dishonour was impossible. Better she were dead; or, if alive,
reunion was henceforth impossible, for the hard rules of religious
faith must exclude her from all assistance and sympathy. These
were home truths which, sooner or later, Vyas Shastree himself
would acknowledge; and Radha's plan was overruled.</p>

<p>It was some days before an answer came. Communications
were necessarily slow when there were only foot messengers to carry
them. The Shastree's fever had passed away, and his wound was
progressing favourably. Mentally and bodily, he had passed a
fearful crisis; but natures like his bow to these calamities rather
than break, and there was hope at least in the messenger who had
gone, to which they all clung.</p>

<p>Little by little they heard enough to sustain this hope. The
Bhóslay's correspondent, a banker in the town of Sholapoor, had
spared no pains for the recovery of Vyas Shastree's child; but beyond
the fact that in the family of Afzool Khan there was a new Hindu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
slave, of great beauty, who was carefully secluded in the zenana, he
could ascertain nothing; and the inquiries, he wrote, must be continued
in camp, for the force had marched, and was now some
stages distant, going towards Wye.</p>

<p>Again, after an interval of weary expectation, and the daily endurance
of that heavy weight of uncertainty which is so often worse
than the bitterest agony of reality, there came fresh news which
they could not doubt. A poor Brahmun of Sholapoor, incited by
the offer of reward held out by the Shastree's friends, had proceeded
to camp, and returned from it direct. They never forgot that evening
of his arrival. The Shastree had, meanwhile, been removed to his
own house, as soon as it had undergone purification, and lay, weak
as yet, but convalescent, in the verandah of the inner court, living,
as he said, in sight of the objects most loved by his lost child; and
it was almost an occupation to watch dreamily Tara's bright flowers
glowing in the sunlight. He was lying there, watching them, as
the evening sun declined, and the colour of its light was growing
richer as the shadows of the buildings lengthened, and Anunda had
just said he must retire to his room; but he was pleading to be
allowed to stay, when the man was announced without.</p>

<p>Weary and footsore, Radha and a servant poured water over his
feet, and led him in. "There was no bad news," he said; "none,
Tara was well." Then they all listened, with grateful hearts and
tears of joy, to the man's tale of having discovered her, though he
could not get speech of her or send a message to her; but in Afzool
Khan's family there was a Brahmun girl called Tara, who was an
honoured guest; her people had been killed, they said, and they
were taking her to Wye, to her relatives. He had watched several
days about the Khan's tents in hope of seeing her, but in vain; for
the servants and soldiers, thinking him a spy, had beaten him and
driven him off. Day by day the distance back to Tooljapoor grew
greater, so he had returned. But there was no doubt; the man
described what he had heard distinctly, and they could now trace
Tara from the temple to where she then was. She must believe
they were all dead, and was going to their relatives at Wye: and
she was at least safe from Moro Trimmul, whom the messenger
reported to be in close confinement.</p>

<p>Now, for once, there was no indecision or vacillation in the Shastree's
mind. He could bear easy travelling in a litter; and Radha
should have it by-and-by, when he grew stronger. He would not
delay, and they could yet overtake the army at Wye, or soon afterwards.
Very little of the household property had been lost, after all;
and Anunda's store of money was at last to prove useful. That
night, as with thankful hearts they spoke of their lost child, they
arranged plans for setting out to reclaim her; and their friends,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
who crowded about them with congratulations next day, soon completed
the necessary arrangements. The third day was a lucky one,
according to the planets; and they moved down the pass to Sindphul,
followed by many friends, and the good wishes and prayers of all
who had known Tara from childhood.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_LXVI" id="CHAPTER_LXVI">CHAPTER LXVI.</a></h2>


<p>A pleasant life was it to Tara. The daily stages of a large army
encumbered with heavy materiel are necessarily slow at all times, and
the country roads were not as yet dry from the recent rains, so that
the force could not hurry on. The Khan himself was in no haste.
On the arrival of the Mahratta ambassadors he had received them
courteously, and insisted upon their being the guests of the royal
camp. They had not much to say, beyond general protestations of
attachment. Their master's demands were simple, they knew; but
he would treat for them in person when he met the Khan. Meanwhile,
supplies for the royal forces were abundant; the stages they
arranged were shorter perhaps than the Khan, and especially Fazil,
approved of; but they found grain and forage provided everywhere,
and the camp bazar had always the appearance of a busy fair.</p>

<p>On his own part, Afzool Khan, yielding to the persuasions of
Sivaji's agents, despatched an envoy of his own, the Brahmun Punto
Gopináth, to Pertâbgurh. Their master's mind, they said, would be
relieved by it; and as Sivaji had evinced confidence in sending his
own servants unsolicited, so a similar mark of courtesy could hardly
be refused. The Khan did not object to it. The Envoy received his
instructions, to act as circumstances might require, leaving all points
of detail for future arrangement; and Bulwunt Rao was placed in
command of the escort which accompanied him. In this capacity he
was safe against all local enemies; and he went the more willingly,
as he trusted, under this opportunity, to interest the Rajah in his
own affairs.</p>

<p>So there was no hurry, and it was a pleasant life. Every day, or
nearly so, there was a change; the force moved forward a few miles,
or it halted; tents were pitched, thrown down, moved, and again
pitched in pleasant places; perhaps in some soft grassy plain
spangled with flowers, or in a stubble field with the stacks of ripe
grain standing around them. The Khan's Durbar tent was open to
all comers, where the leaders of the various bodies of troops met
every day for business or ceremonial visits, as it might be: behind
it the private tents enclosed by a canvas wall, which afforded a large
area. Before all, floated the royal standard, and a place was cleared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
near it which was appropriated for public prayer. Five times in
each day, if the force halted, did the musical chant of invitation to
prayer resound from this spot; and as often did the devout among
the soldiery assemble there, and perform the stated devotions.
Every afternoon the priest and other divines preached to the people;
and it was remarked that the sermons on the holy war, though they
were continued at intervals, were of quieter character than they used
to be at first.</p>

<p>Perhaps the religious zeal of the Peer had relaxed since the
slaughter at Tooljapoor, and was satisfied with the fact of the idol
having been overthrown and defiled. Perhaps the Khan supposed
enough had been done to terrify the Mahratta people, and that the
rest would follow upon negotiation.</p>

<p>There was very little change in the daily life: the early march,
the halt for the day, the household occupations, and then the pleasant
talk with Zyna and Lurlee. Her tales of the Hindu life, and of her
home pleasures and occupations, were told again and again by Tara,
often with bitter tears, and yet told again and again, and heard by
sympathizing friends.</p>

<p>Two different worlds, as it were, were thus brought together.
What did the simple Brahmun girl know of the grandeur of Mahomedan
nobles, of which only a faint rumour had ever reached her?
To her unclean, she would once have shuddered at nearer contact
with them, however rich or grand they might be. Now, how
different! They had respected her honour, and they also respected
her faith; and every day her little cooking-place was arranged, with
water brought by a Brahmun for her bath and her drinking, which
no one interfered with. Sometimes, Zyna and Lurlee would look on
while the little maiden dressed her simple meal, as she had often done
at home,&mdash;amused, and wondering at her dexterity; and it was not
long before the Khan himself was a petitioner for some delicate
specimen of her handiwork, which, it was remarked, he ate with
infinite relish, and pronounced better even than Kurreema's efforts
to the same end.</p>

<p>They procured the girl the books she loved, and eagerly, and with
infinite animation, she would read and expound sacred texts, which
even the priest admitted contained at least moral and virtuous
doctrine. Occasionally, too, he was unable to control himself, and
he answered the little preacher from his own books, hurling at her
texts translated from the Kôrán into bad Mahratta; and half angry
with, and half amused by, the seeming petulance with which she
resisted conversion, allowed her greater liberties, perhaps, than he
had ever been known to submit to before from "an infidel."</p>

<p>"See," she would cry, "Huzrut! here are God's holy words to us
poor Hindus hundreds of thousands of years old, but yours are, after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
all, but a few hundreds. Surely the elder has precedence?" If she
could translate the beautiful Bhugwat Geeta to him, that book so
full of mystic religious doctrine, he could understand her better, she
thought; but she had no words that he could comprehend, in which
to convey the sense of the noble Sanscrit; and it must be confessed
that her general attempts in argument were failures.</p>

<p>Kind Tara! gentle Tara! was any servant ill,&mdash;and the cold air
and damp earth gave many fevers,&mdash;who so ready with knowledge
of simples as the Brahmun girl? who so watchful, who so careful?
In turn she had tended Lurlee and Zyna, who suffered at first from
the change and exposure in camp. Then Fazil grew ill too, and for
several days could not ride. She could ride: she had never travelled
in a palankeen in her life&mdash;her father could not afford one: so she
gave up her litter to him, and rode a stout ambling palfrey of the
Khan's which was gentle, and a relief on long marches from his
heavier war-horse; and old Shêre Khan and his men, her first escort
from Tooljapoor, claimed the privilege of guarding her as she rode,
rapidly and fearlessly, and managed the active horse with skill and
grace.</p>

<p>Once Moro Trimmul saw her riding with this escort of heavily-armed
men. She was wrapped in shawls, and had twisted one round
her head like a turban, which covered her face all but her eyes. He
concealed his own face and person as she passed, but the fact that
she was riding with so noble a company to attend on her, disquieted
him. "She is growing into favour," he thought, "and is in danger.
It is necessary to act before we reach Wye."</p>

<p>Whether Moro Trimmul was in camp or not, she had not thought
to inquire. Fazil had told her once, with a very perceptible tone of
disappointment, that he had been released, and had gone away. He
was never seen in the camp, but, with Sivaji's envoys, put up in
villages near where the force might halt. They did not vex her
with his tale of her having been taken away under her father's
sanction, which Fazil, Lurlee, and Zyna had never believed, and by
common consent the name of the Brahmun was never mentioned
among them.</p>

<p>Ah, yes, a pleasant time indeed! What more delicious to a young
girl's heart than the consciousness of awakening love? Could she
help it? did she desire it? Neither, perhaps; but it would come
nevertheless: and there would come too, with all the persuasive adjuncts
of her own helplessness and dependence, the sense of evident
respect in which she was held by Fazil, and his honourable reticence,
even of speech with her. So a new life, a new desire for life, was
growing within her, and increased day by day. Did she endeavour
to check it? Not then; it was too delicious.</p>

<p>Before it, the old home was fading away, the forms of father and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
mother already becoming dim and shadowy, as belonging to the past.
The old temple occupations, the preparation for daily duty, were
being supplanted by other feelings, undecided as yet, but ineffably
tender. Did she regret that these were growing into definite form
in her own heart? Not then. She had no certainty of what she
thought, and if any one, even Zyna, had asked her to define what
was passing within her, she could not have done so.</p>

<p>O, the wondrous stirring of that new life, shutting out all the
old! the gentle growing of an absorbing passion. If Fazil spoke to
her, she trembled; but not in fear. She had no fear of him. No
matter what he said, she listened, and never replied. When he was
ill, she took to him the little soothing potions she had made, and,
as he lay tossing with fever, was conscious that they would relieve
thirst, and would not be forgotten. She could speak to him then, a
word only, perhaps, to tell him to be patient, that he would be relieved
if he would be still. Even this was a fearful but an exquisite
pleasure.</p>

<p>How often Zyna spoke of her brother! How precious he was to
her; how brave he was; how beautiful! Had Tara ever seen any
one like him? No; those timid, loving eyes had never looked up
to any one before, far less to such a one as Fazil. What did she
know? She could only see that there was, in her eyes, the godlike
beauty the old poets wrote of K&#257;mdeo&mdash;those soft, loving eyes which
sometimes earnestly looked into hers, before which she dare not open
her own. If he came into the tent accoutred, blazing with cloth-of-gold
and steel armour, she fled at once, and from a distance watched
Zyna embrace him, perhaps fasten an amulet upon his arm, or relieve
him of his heavy clothing and armour.</p>

<p>If Fazil were absent, Tara and Zyna would often sit and talk of
him. Poor little heart! how it fluttered then. She could not tell
his sister what rose to her lips, but, as her heart swelled, she felt as
if she could do some great thing for him or for Zyna&mdash;defend them,
or avert evil from them&mdash;even if she died herself, it would be welcome.
Yes, the old story&mdash;the old story!&mdash;the telling of which, in
all its wondrous forms, will never finish here, or finish, but to be
renewed hereafter!</p>

<p>Did Fazil perceive this? Not yet. He had a true gentleman's
best safeguard against presumption, an innate modesty in regard to
women, which prevented it; and yet ... how often he watched
the lithe and graceful figure as it passed from his presence on some
trifling errand, or the glowing intellectual face as it quivered under
the excitement of explaining any portion of one of her old-world
books which interested her,&mdash;or the quiet, demure expression which
gathered over it, as she sometimes brought&mdash;for she would allow no-one
else to touch the vessels she cooked it in&mdash;her little daily contribution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
to his father's dinner, and waited apart with folded arms
till he had told her, with a pleasant smile or joke, how much he
liked it!</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Shêre Khan, after Fazil's first journey in the palankeen,
and as he lay, languid and weakened by his fever, in the outer tent
where his retainers could attend on him&mdash;"whom hast thou sent us,
Meah? They tell of Chandnee Bégum of the Nizam Shahee's, but
who, after all, was one of our royal race,&mdash;that she rode with her
army of true believers, and fought with her enemies. By Alla! this
girl rides so that it is hard to follow her; and we all say, there is
that in her eyes which, had she a sword in her hand, nay, without it,
would lead us, as only thou, or the Khan could lead us, Meah. Yes,
she is a jewel of great price."</p>

<p>And Fazil liked to hear this; he liked to hear old Goolab exhaust
her vocabulary of endearment upon Tara, as she sat by him, rubbing
his feet when the fever oppressed him; and when, in those feverish
dreams which are part of the disorder, strange fancies beset him, the
Brahmun girl often became a prominent actor in those unreal scenes
of his imagination.</p>

<p>So it grew on. The habits of Eastern people do not admit of
those demonstrations and protestations of love which form part of
our social habits. But we have no warrant for saying that their
feelings are the less ardent or permanent. We think not; and that
there, as elsewhere, they progress silently, and are afterwards called
into active exercise by occasion and opportunity, and with possibly
more energy and passion than among ourselves.</p>

<p>When Lurlee had rallied the Brahmun girl sometimes upon her
attachment to her old faith, now, she said, hopeless,&mdash;and Zyna,
throwing her arms round her as they sat together in the twilight
after evening prayer, besought her to give it up&mdash;to come to them
as a sister, as a daughter,&mdash;and pleaded hard for this,&mdash;Tara was
sorely tried. Whom had she now to look to? whither was she
going? If there were some of her mother's relatives at Wye,&mdash;and
all she knew of them was the surname,&mdash;what was she to do?
Even were they there, what was she to do? Against her, ever rose
up the hard cruel wall of Hindu widowhood; the servitude, the
nearly inevitable dishonour among strangers, of her own faith, the
hopeless weariness of an unloved and uncared-for life; and so, better
death. All this had passed through her mind before, at Tooljapoor,
and then there was no alternative. Now?</p>

<p>O, how hard the new young life pleaded&mdash;as these thoughts passed
through her mind&mdash;the certainty of love on the one hand, even as
a friend or dependant, and of respect and protection from all evil,
even though to minister to the old Khan should be her only occupation.
This, and to see Fazil daily&mdash;to see Zyna&mdash;to be held to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
that rough old Lurlee's heart&mdash;to be the child, for so they called
her, of all the servants,&mdash;what had the other life to compare with
this? Even if she found her people, what had they to offer her but
misery? for so it seemed.</p>

<p>And when, one day (Wye was now only a few stages distant),
Zyna told her what they wished&mdash;what they all spoke of among
themselves&mdash;what Fazil had proposed to his father,&mdash;and how the
old Khan had at first gently resisted it, desiring a high connection
for his son, and yet had conceded in the end;&mdash;when Lurlee came
and pleaded too, and told her, and proved to her by the planets
and the elements, that she would be fortunate to the house and to
Fazil&mdash;a loved and honoured wife,&mdash;what could she say? The new
life now rose up within her vigorous and defiant against all other
thoughts; and its blessed shape&mdash;definite, honourable, irresistible,
and delicious to contemplate&mdash;would not be repelled.</p>

<p>"Only give me time," she cried, hiding her burning face in Zyna's
bosom&mdash;"only give me time! It is so sudden&mdash;so unlooked-for."
Then she added, after a pause, and looking up sadly, "I am his
captive and his slave; not of your people, lady, but a stranger, and
an infidel, as the priest says; impure among my own sect, and of no
account but for shame and dishonour. As such, I cannot come to a
noble house. Ah, do not mock me!"</p>

<p>"They say," returned Zyna, "that the Emperors of Delhi sought
brides from among the Rajpoots, and esteemed them as honourable
and as noble as themselves; and thou art a Brahmun, Tara, far
purer and nobler than they. But no matter: thou art our own
Tara, whom Alla hath sent to us, and whom we have received
thankfully, for him whose heart no one as yet has touched. Let it
be as we all will;" and Tara, at last, said it should be so.</p>

<p>Was she grateful or happy, this desolate girl? O, far beyond
either! All those dreamy imaginings which at home, among her
books and flowers, had taken no definite shape, now assumed a
palpable reality. In her eyes glorious, in her heart Fazil was
supremely glorious also. She dared not look at him now, even by
stealth; but there was ever a sweet assurance of his presence&mdash;of
his care&mdash;of his thought, which produced a kind of ecstasy, filling
her mind with a sublime devotion and innocent passion: often
filling her eyes, too, causing a strangely tight feeling at her heart as
if she could not breathe, and then a deep sigh as her tears welled
over; and she hoped, with an almost delirious joy, that she was to
belong to him by-and-by: no matter how far distant it might be,&mdash;only
to belong to him, and be for ever with him.</p>

<p>And so the time passed to them all. A pleasant life which, day
by day, grew to be more absorbing to Tara, and caused indifference
to outward occurrences. But had her enemy been idle?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span></p>

<p>The force marched late one day. Moro Trimmul had ascertained
that the litters and followers generally, would not arrive in camp
before nightfall. It was dark, for there was no moon; and he laid
his plans accordingly. Day and night, he and Gunga, in various
disguises, had watched about the Khan's tents, and had tried to get
speech of the servants. He dare not come openly, except to the
Khan's Durbar, where he heard nothing. He was nearly hopeless
of success, when he understood casually that the evening march was
determined upon. All the force was not to move; but some only
with the Khan, for the sake of convenience of supplies and water.
It was a short stage&mdash;only four or five miles, and the Khan's tents
were to precede the force. He and his family were to remain in a
village for the night, and several houses had been cleared for him.
Thus much had Gunga picked up, and for once, fortune seemed to
favour their designs.</p>

<p>Fazil had recovered, and again rode with his men. Tara, therefore,
once more occupied the litter, which was closed, and carried
with those of Lurlee and Zyna. Had she continued to ride as she
wished, nothing could have happened. As it grew dark Moro Trimmul&mdash;with
a small body of horsemen which he had detached from
the Envoy's and kept about his own person&mdash;followed Tara's litter
at a distance, and yet so as not to interfere with it. As it grew
dark, and they neared the place where they were to stop for the
night, he observed that Tara's palankeen was the last: he knew it
from the white devices sewn on the red cover; and he dexterously,
yet apparently unpremeditatedly, pushed his horsemen between
it and the others, in a narrow lane, in which litters, horsemen,
and soldiers were much crowded together. Then he stopped his
men, pretending there was obstruction in front; and so the litters
of Lurlee and Zyna, which were surrounded by footguards and
guides as usual, went on for some distance, never missing the one
behind.</p>

<p>Moro Trimmul was exultant. At the next turn in the road, his
own servants, who had been instructed beforehand, went to the
bearers of Tara's litter, pretending to have been seeking them, and,
abusing them roundly for their carelessness in remaining behind,
bade them come on rapidly. The men followed blindly; they knew
they were to go to a village, and here was one; and, pressing forward,
they presently reached a house to which they were directed.</p>

<p>"Put down the palankeen. Gosha! Gosha! Murdana! Murdana!"
was cried by several voices; and a screen of cloth being
stretched, as usual, from the palankeen to the entrance of the court,
and the door of the litter opened, Tara emerged from it unsuspiciously:
then the door was instantly closed behind her, a thick
shawl was thrown round her head which almost stifled her, and she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
felt herself taken up by powerful arms, and carried rapidly onwards.
She struggled violently, but a voice she knew but too well, hissed into
her ear through the shawl, "Be quiet, else I will kill you;" and for
a moment she lost consciousness.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_LXVII" id="CHAPTER_LXVII">CHAPTER LXVII.</a></h2>


<p>Tara revived as the shawl was pushed roughly from her head, and
the cool air reached her face; in another moment she was set down
in a verandah, closed from the outer court by thick woollen curtains,
in which a small lamp, placed in a niche, glimmered faintly. There
could be no doubt now. Releasing her, Moro Trimmul drew himself
up, panting with the exertion of carrying her, and looked at her
from head to foot ere he spoke; while Gunga, advancing from a
dark corner of the room, and bending lowly with a mock gesture of
reverence, touched the ground near her feet, and then retreated a
pace so as to see her better.</p>

<p>"Thou hast had powerful friends, Tara," said the Brahmun
bitterly, and with a scornful sneer&mdash;"very powerful; even the
enemy's general and his fair son; but the gods are not with them,
but with me. Once, in blood and terror, didst thou escape me;
but not now, girl&mdash;never more. Now thou art mine, and there is
nothing between thee and me; nor sister, nor father, nor mother;
only thee, and only me; and thou hast a long account of misery to
pay me."</p>

<p>"The holy Moorlee of the goddess forgot her faith and her vow
among the cow-slaying infidels; and the Mother hath sent me to
bring her back from her dainty lover, who rides in cloth-of-gold and
bright armour," said Gunga, with another mock reverence. "Art
thou ready, O Moorlee of Toolja Máta? ready to be such as I am,
in her service? Come! there is thy master and mine; be content
that thou art saved the sin of faithlessness to her. Didst thou think
she&mdash;the Mother," continued the girl, advancing a step at each word
till she was close to Tara, who shrank from her&mdash;"the Mother would
loose thee from thy vow to be the petted toy of an unclean Toork?
O Tara, didst thou think it? Ah, yes! I know thou didst, faithless,
when the fair boy's arms were about thee."</p>

<p>"Silence!" cried Tara panting, as these bitter words stung her to
the quick. "Silence! thou art shameless, Gunga. O, what have
I ever done to harm thee, that thou hast such bitter enmity to
me?"</p>

<p>"Thou art beautiful, and I hate thee for that. I hated thee
long ago, before thou wast a Moorlee," she replied. "He loved me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
once, that Moro Trimmul there; now he cries, 'Tara! Tara!' all
day long, like a sick child, and will not look on me. Thou wilt hate
me because I have taken thee from thy beautiful lover; but, O Tara,
more deeply do I hate thee for taking mine from me. Look, he gave
me this gold zone. It is as heavy as thine&mdash;heavier. That is all I
have left&mdash;that is all. He will give thee another, by-and-by; not
now, but when he has done with thee. Enough! Take her away,
Moro Trimmul. I have done thy bidding, and earned the gold.
Take her away&mdash;far away&mdash;ere I repent of this, the worst work of
my life, and join her against thee. Go!"</p>

<p>"Gunga! Gunga! go not," cried Tara, seizing her dress. "There
is pity in thy heart, let it come out to me. O, leave me not to him,
by your mother, by your&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Come," cried Moro Trimmul fiercely, casting his arm about her.
"This is child's play, come.... Nay, Tara, gently, and it were
better for thee&mdash;else I will strike thee," he said, under his breath,
but with a terrible distinctness, as she struggled violently, shrieking
as she did so. "Gunga! the shawl. Quick, girl&mdash;lest she be heard
without. Quick! Bar the outer door."</p>

<p>It was too late. Several persons, among whom was an elderly
Brahmun of sedate and respectable appearance, attended by armed
retainers, came up the steps hurriedly and entered the room. Between
the noise of Tara's shrieks and his own exertions, Moro
Trimmul had not heard them, and with Gunga's aid had forced
Tara to the ground, and was endeavouring to tie the shawl about
her head, which she was resisting with all her might; but Gunga
had succeeded in catching her hands, and Tara was much exhausted.
Another instant, and she would have been helplessly in their power;
but at this moment Gunga saw the curtain pushed aside, and one of
the men enter with his sword drawn; and, loosing Tara, she upset
the cruise burning in the niche, and fled into an inner portion of the
dark apartment.</p>

<p>"Who art thou?" cried the man, darting forward and seizing
Moro Trimmul's arm; "what murder is this thou art doing?"</p>

<p>He had had no time to escape, or even to rise from his kneeling
posture to shake off the soldier's grip, and two others also caught
him at the same moment; while the elderly man, calling earnestly
for a light, raised up Tara, and disengaged her from the shawl which
had been thrown about her. "Art thou wounded?" he said.</p>

<p>"By the Holy Mother," cried one of the men with whom Moro
Trimmul was struggling violently, "be quiet, else I will drive my
knife into thee. Bind him, brothers, he may be armed. Quick!"</p>

<p>At this moment a man bearing a lighted torch came into the court
from the street, and ran rapidly up the steps into the room. As the
light flashed upon the struggling group of men, the leader of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
party recognized Moro Trimmul, and bid his retainers release him.
As they did so, Tara, who had partly risen, sank again to the ground,
clasping his knees, and crying piteously for protection.</p>

<p>The old Brahmun understood the situation at a glance. "There
was another woman here,&mdash;seize her!" he exclaimed. She was not,
however, to be found. "Peace," he said to Tara, "peace, my
daughter; be comforted, no one shall harm thee. Who art thou?
What has happened?"</p>

<p>"I am the unhappy daughter of Vyas Shastree of Tooljapoor, who
was murdered, and I am an orphan," she cried sobbing. "O, defend
me from him; he would have done me violence and dishonour."</p>

<p>"Moro Trimmul," said the old man sadly, "how often hast thou
been warned, and what new wickedness is this?&mdash;against a Brahmun
girl too, and the daughter of the man to whom thy sister was given!
O, shame!"</p>

<p>"She is a Moorlee," he replied sulkily, "and has done dishonour
to the Mother by living with Mussulmans in camp. It was from
them I have rescued her, and would have taken her to Wye, but she
resisted. I have done no evil, Pundit, nor intended any."</p>

<p>"Is this true, girl?" asked the Brahmun.</p>

<p>"Quite true, Maharaj," answered Tara, sobbing hysterically, and
hardly knowing what she said: "only take me hence, and I will tell
thee all; but I am not impure,&mdash;I am not defiled,&mdash;I have nothing
to be ashamed of. O, put your hand on my head, and take me to
my people in Wye. Save me, else I shall die; or kill me, rather
than let him or the woman come near me. When I am alone with
your family I will tell them all."</p>

<p>"Come," said the man, who was Govind Narrayen, the principal
envoy of the Rajah Sivaji, and a Brahmun of wealth and high station
in the country, best known among the people under the familiar title
of Baba Sahib. "I am well known, and I knew and honoured your
father, and grieve his death. Come with me, and you shall go on
with my people at once to Wye. They leave the camp to avoid the
confusion, and will take care of you, and the bearers and palankeen
are still in the street.</p>

<p>"As to you, Moro Trimmul," he continued, turning to him, "I
reserve my judgment till I have inquired from this girl of what she
complains. I bid you, however, beware. The Maharaja is not what
he used to be, and will submit to no profligacy now. I take this girl
as my daughter, and she is safe against you. Beware!" And so
saying, and giving his arm for Tara to lean on, while he partly supported
her with the other, he led her out, and once more placed her
in the litter, which was taken up and carried forward rapidly.</p>

<p>The Envoy and his escort had also moved with the camp, and he
had sent on his family to a stage some miles distant. As he passed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
through the street of the village where Tara had been set down, the
bearers of her litter, who had remained with it, hearing the stifled
scream from within the court, and alarmed by the sudden closing
and fastening of the door, had stopped Baba Sahib as he went by,
and besought him to see whether Tara was not in danger. He had
dismounted, some of his men had burst in the court door, and we
know the rest.</p>

<p>"Again baffled, O witch that thou art!" cried Moro Pundit, flinging
himself on the ground as Tara passed out, and tearing up the
clay of the floor in the agony of his passion: "what sent that
meddling fool to aid thee? If it had been only that proud boy she
loves, ah! I would have slain him and her together. Gunga!
Gunga! where art thou? O girl, I burn&mdash;I choke! She too is
gone, devil that she is. If thou hadst only helped me sooner I had
stopped the screams, and no one could have heard them. Gunga!
dost thou hear? By&mdash;&mdash;," and he swore a frightful oath, "come
hither, or I will come and stab thee: art thou too playing with me?
Beware!"</p>

<p>The girl advanced from a dark corner trembling, yet without fear;
and as she did so, he raised himself on his arm, and she saw him
grasp a knife at his waist-band. "Kill me," she said, "if thou wilt;
twice I have aided thee, and twice the Mother hath saved her from
us. I will have no more of it."</p>

<p>"No more!" cried the Brahmun, starting to his feet, and seizing
her arm he shook her roughly&mdash;"no more! This from thee? I tell
thee we have gone too far to recede. Will that old dotard be quiet?
Will he spare my character? Not he. He has been my enemy from
the first, supplanted me in my authority, crossed me in every design,
and lastly in this.&mdash;Why didst thou bungle with the shawl? Coward!
witch! devil!"&mdash;and he struck her violently on the face with his
open hand at each word. "Why didst thou fail me? Go!" and he
flung her away from him, so that she tottered and fell heavily against
the wall beyond. "Go! may&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Her fall and agony of mind prevented her hearing the frightful
curses which followed. Once before, when his sister had come to
him, the paroxysm of passion had been like this, but only once, and
yet he had not dared to strike her. She was not stunned, but O, the
misery of her mind! She felt her lips were cut, and her mouth was
bleeding. The pain of this, the degradation of having been struck,
made the girl desperate. If she had had a dagger she would have
stabbed Moro or herself. She could see him very dimly, for the place
was dark except the faint light which came in from the drawn
curtains. She saw that he was sitting, leaning against one of the
wooden pillars of the room, rocking himself to and fro. He had
drawn his knife, and a faint gleam of the naked blade was seen now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
and again as he moved. Was she to die, or he? No matter. In a
frame of mind like hers death has no terror. It is only the return
to consciousness which brings fear with it, and she lay crouching on
the ground, but watching him intently. If he moved towards her,
she knew she must die; but he did not move, and suddenly the
rocking ceased, he seemed to fall heavily to one side, and lay there
motionless.</p>

<p>Was he feigning, in order to get her into his power? No, it did
not seem so, for he lay still, breathing heavily. She had heard that
thick heavy breathing once before, and now recognized it again.
Still she was cautious. She rose gently, and stepping lightly forward
stood over him, yet near enough to the steps to escape if he
moved. The knife had fallen from his hand, and lay beside him.
She took it up, and placed it in her own waist-band. He was insensible;
his turban had partly fallen off, and his face lay towards the
light, turned upwards. He could not harm her now,&mdash;he was in her
power.... The evil spirit within tugged hard at her heart, and
she drew the knife. Then the blood from her lip trickled into her
mouth, and the wound smarted and urged on her hand. If he had
risen and spoken a word to her, she would have killed him; but as
he lay so helpless, the girl's heart once more softened. "It is my
death, I know," she said; "let him kill me; I cannot kill him, and
this faint will pass away. Now she is gone, he may love me again."
Poor fool, to think it!</p>

<p>Then she watched a few moments, and as she sat down by him
raised his head into her lap. The face was cold and clammy; was
this death? There was no water, else she would sprinkle some on
him, but she fanned him with the end of her garment, and after a
while he opened his eyes gently. "Gunga!" he said, stretching out
his arms, "where art thou, girl? come to me." It was the old tone
of kindness, almost sad. Poor fond fool, she did not resist it; and,
wiping the blood from her lips, kissed his forehead.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Tara, sorely shaken in body and mind, had been put
into the litter. She heard the bearers ask the old Brahmun whether
they were to take her to Afzool Khan's tents; and he had opened
the door, and said to her kindly that she had better come to her own
people, and that his wife and sister, who knew them, would take
charge of her, and be kind to her; that they were at a village some
miles further on, and he himself would escort her there.</p>

<p>She was helpless to object: in the first place, she dare not prefer
the Mussulman noble's house, as strangers to her faith and to her
own people; nor dare she resist a Brahmun of the Envoy's powerful
position in whatever he chose to do. She had no alternative, indeed,
for he shut the door ere she could reply, the bearers took her forward
at a rapid pace, and the night was somewhat advanced, ere she was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
again set down at the door of a respectable house in a village, and
several women-servants, such as are menials in Brahmun families,
kindly assisted her to alight, bringing what there was in the palankeen
after her.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_LXVIII" id="CHAPTER_LXVIII">CHAPTER LXVIII.</a></h2>


<p>It was a house something like their own at Tooljapoor. There was
the master's seat, with its flowers and holy text painted on it; the
verandah open to the court; the thick curtains between the pillars
let down to exclude the night air, which was chill. The room was
neat and scrupulously clean. She was once more in a Brahmun's
house.</p>

<p>Before Tara sat two women, both elderly. One a stout and
matronly figure, with a grave but kind countenance, and grey hair
neatly braided, with heavy gold rings round her neck, wrists, and
ankles, plainly but richly dressed, indicating rank and wealth; the
other evidently a widow, clad in coarse white serge, her head clean
shaved, and her wrists, ankles, and neck without any ornaments.
She had strong coarse features, much wrinkled, small piercing eyes
deep set in her head, and her skin was flaccid and shrivelled. She
was the elder sister of the Envoy, and lived with him a life of austere
penance and privation, and, as a Hindu widow, was a pattern of
scrupulous attention to the rules of her faith. Neither rose to
meet her.</p>

<p>Tara advanced and touched their feet in token of reverential submission
and salutation. By the lady, whose evident rank had
attracted Tara first, the action was received at least without repugnance,
and perhaps with interest; but by the other with marked
aversion&mdash;she drew back her feet as though to prevent pollution,
and shrank aside, evidently to avoid contact.</p>

<p>"Thou art welcome, daughter of Vyas Shastree," said the one:
"peace be with thee."</p>

<p>"And that gilded thing is called a widow and a Moorlee!" cried
the other, with a scornful glance at Tara. "O sister, admit her not!
Why has she any hair? Why is she more like a bride than a widow?&mdash;a
harlot rather than a virtuous woman?"</p>

<p>"I am a widow and an orphan," returned Tara meekly, sinking
down and trembling violently, as she addressed the first speaker.
"I have been saved from dishonour, lady. O be kind to me! I
have no one on earth to protect me now. They are all gone&mdash;all&mdash;and
may God help me!"</p>

<p>"Your mother was one of the Durpeys of Wye, was she not?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
asked the Envoy's wife, whose name was Amba Bye. "Do they
know of thee?"</p>

<p>"I do not know, lady," returned Tara; "they have never been to
us, nor we to them; but my mother was a Durpey, and used to speak
of them."</p>

<p>"Her father lately married that wild sister of Moro Trimmul's,
and Sukya Bye is sure to know her," said the widow.</p>

<p>"O, not to her!&mdash;not to her!" cried Tara passionately&mdash;"do not
give me to her? I beseech you by your honour, by your children,
lady, by all you love on earth, not to give me to her. Do with me
as ye will yourselves, ye are matrons, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And why not, girl?" asked the widow, interrupting her.</p>

<p>"Peace! Pudma Bye," said her brother, now entering, and seeing
that his sister's question had caused pain, "the girl hath had a sore
trial; listen to her, ere thou art hard on her. Speak, daughter, let
us know from thine own lips how and why thou wast suffering
violence from Moro Trimmul."</p>

<p>"From Moro Trimmul!" exclaimed both ladies in a breath.</p>

<p>"Yes, from him did I rescue her, sister, else she had fared badly,
I fear," returned the Envoy. "A violent and wicked man,&mdash;who
must be brought before the council, to prevent further scandal. But
speak, daughter,&mdash;thy name?"</p>

<p>"Tara."</p>

<p>"Tara: well, fear not. Amba Bye is strict, but kind. Speak
truly, we listen."</p>

<p>And Tara told her little story: how she had become a priestess
when the goddess called her; what she knew of holy books; how
she had been carried off from the temple by Moro Trimmul, and
how he had persecuted her before. How she was taken by Fazil
Khan, and had been saved by him from the King's harem at
Beejapoor. Finally, how they had treated her with honour and
respect, and were taking her to her only refuge at Wye.</p>

<p>Ah, it was a sad story now: a glimpse of a heaven of delight now
shut out from her for ever! She saw the stony eyes of the grim
old widow wandering over her, from her glossy braided hair and
the garland of jessamine flowers which Zyna had put into it just
before they left camp, to the gold ornaments about her neck which
Zyna would have her wear; and, above all, to the silken saree, and
the golden anklets which Fazil liked, because the tiny bells to them
clashed so musically as she walked. Over and over again, as she
told her simple story, and was believed by the Baba Sahib and his
wife, did his sister evince decided unbelief and scorn. But at the
last her brother rebuked her.</p>

<p>"I rescued her myself from violence," he said, "and what she tells
me confirms her whole story. Peace, Pudma! one so helpless and
so beautiful should have thy pity, not thy scorn."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span></p>

<p>"Let her have her head shaved, and be such as I am; let her live
with me, and bathe in cold water before dawn; let her say the name
of God on her beads a thousand times an hour during the night; let
her do menial service," cried the widow rapidly; "and then, if she
can do these things, brother, she is a Brahmun widow, and true;
else cast her out to the Mussulmans with whom she lived. Art thou
ready to do all this, girl?" she continued, stretching out her long
skinny flaccid arm, which was naked to the shoulder, and showed
that the serge about her was her only garment.</p>

<p>Tara's spirit sank within her. Yes, such as the being before her
were Hindu widows&mdash;such they would claim her to be. "It were
better if I were dead," she groaned&mdash;"better if I were dead."</p>

<p>"Better if thou wast dead!" echoed the widow. "Ay, much
better. Such as thou art, were better dead than live, in a harlot's
guise, to be a disgrace to the faith!"</p>

<p>"Nay, peace, sister," said her brother&mdash;"I will have none of this.
While she is with us, she is our guest and daughter, and shall be
cared for tenderly. Take her away, Amba, and let her rest. I will
see Afzool Khan at the Durbar to-morrow, and inquire if what she
says be true; but my heart already tells me it is so."</p>

<p>Amba Bye rose and said a few soothing words to Tara as she stood
over her and raised her up. "Come," she said, "I will not harm
thee&mdash;come." And Tara rose and followed her to an inner room.
The old lady had perhaps been afraid of her sister-in-law, or she was
softened by Tara's beauty and grief, for, as she closed the door, she
sat down and took her to her heart, laying her head on her bosom.
"Thou art a gentle lamb," she said, stroking her head. "God help
thee, child," and Tara clung to the kind heart, and felt, as it were,
loving arms once more closed around her.</p>

<p>That night she slept with Amba Bye. Her sleep was at first
broken, and full of fearful dreams; but wearied nature and youth
in the end obtained their mastery over her, and she sank into a
deep slumber,&mdash;so deep, that the sun was high in the morning ere
she awoke.</p>

<p>It had been a weary time to Zyna, Lurlee, and the Khan's household,
and even the Khan and the priest sat up far into the night,
speaking of Tara. No one had slept. As to Fazil, he, with Shêre
Khan, Lukshmun, and a body of horse, rode round the country for
miles, all through the night, seeking Tara. No one dared speak to
him, and the men had never seen him so excited before. He and
Lukshmun, whose activity even surpassed his own, had stopped
every palankeen; every cart or carriage which was covered; every
veiled female they could see. Villages had been searched also, but no
trace of Tara was found&mdash;none; and Fazil returned home dejected
and worn out, only, however, to change his horse and the men, and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
start once more with Lukshmun, who would not leave him, on an
errand equally fruitless. That day (Fazil was still absent) Baba
Sahib sought Afzool Khan after the afternoon Durbar, and told him
what had happened: how he had rescued Tara, how he had sent
her on to Wye with his wife and sister, and how she would be safe
in his hands; and he heard in return how she was respected and
loved in the Khan's family.</p>

<p>"We cannot allow her, Khan," he said kindly, "to remain with
you, much as you have respected her faith. It would be a scandal to
Brahmuns, if the daughter of Vyas Shastree were the guest even of
Afzool Khan and his household. It is not compatible with her purity
or her honour, which, now her father is dead, her people must protect.
We&mdash;that is, my wife and myself&mdash;have charged ourselves
with her for the present; and her people, the Durpeys of Wye, are
rich and devout,&mdash;they will receive and protect her."</p>

<p>Afzool Khan remonstrated as far as possible. Tara had grown to
be a familiar and beautiful object to him; but he felt the Brahmun
was right, and he must not connect her name with his son's. He
dare not mention to Lurlee what had been done, but he told Fazil,
when he returned, and so all knew of it.</p>

<p>"At least she is safe and in honourable keeping," said Fazil, when
he had heard all, "and for the rest, as God wills. But as for that
Brahmun, father, he escaped me once&mdash;it may not be again."</p>

<p>"Look!" cried Lurlee to Zyna, who was sitting sobbing bitterly&mdash;"look!
Had I only been careful, this would never have happened.
It was Sunday night, and Saturn ruled from the second hour of the
first watch to the end. Could anything be worse? We should not
have moved at all. My pearl, my love, she should not have left us!
Hai! Hai! May the peace of the Prophet be with her, and the protection
of Alla be upon her till we meet again!"</p>

<p>"Ameen! Ameen!" sighed Zyna, but she was not comforted, nor
was Fazil.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_LXIX" id="CHAPTER_LXIX">CHAPTER LXIX.</a></h2>


<p>Magnificent as is the scenery of the Western Ghauts of India
throughout their range, it is nowhere, perhaps, more strikingly
beautiful than in the neighbourhood of the great isolated plateau
which&mdash;rising high above the mountain-ranges around it, and known
under the name of Maha-bul-eshwur, from the temple at the source
of the sacred river Krishna on its summit&mdash;is now the favourite
summer retreat and sanatorium of the Bombay Presidency. Trim
roads, laid out so as to exhibit the beauties of the scenery to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
best advantage&mdash;pretty English-looking cottages, with brilliant
gardens, and a considerable native town, are now the main features
of the place; but at the period of our tale it was uninhabited, except
by a few Brahmuns and devotees, who, attracted by the holiness
of the spot, congregated around the ancient temple, and occupied
the small village beside it. Otherwise the character of the wild
scenery is unchanged. From points near the edges of the plateau,
where mighty precipices of basalt descend sheer into forests of ever-lasting
verdure and luxuriance, the eye ranges over a sea of rugged
mountain-tops,&mdash;some, scathed and shattered peaks of barren rock&mdash;others
with extensive flat summits, bounded by naked cliffs which,
falling into deep gloomy ravines covered with dense forests, would
seem inaccessible to man.</p>

<p>To some readers of our tale, this scenery will be familiar; but to
others it is almost impossible to convey by description any adequate
idea of its peculiar character, or of the beauty of the ever-changing
aërial effects, that vary in aspect almost as the spectator turns from
one point to another. Often in early morning, as the sun rises over
the lower mists, the naked peaks and precipices, standing apart like
islands, glisten with rosy tints, while the mist itself, as yet dense
and undisturbed, lies wrapped around their bases, filling every
ravine and valley, and glittering like a sea of molten silver.</p>

<p>Again, as the morning breeze rises in the valleys below, this
vapour breaks up slowly: circling round the mountain summits,
lingering in wreaths among their glens and precipices, and clinging
to the forests, until dissipated entirely by the fierce beams of the
sun. Then, quivering under the fervid heat, long ridges of rugged
valleys are spread out below, and range beyond range melts tenderly
into a dim distance of sea and sky, scarcely separated in colour, yet
showing the occasional sparkle of a sail like a faint cloud passing on
the horizon. Most glorious of all, perhaps, in the evening, when, in
the rich colours of the fast-rising vapours, the mountains glow like
fire; and peak and precipice, forest and glen, are bathed in gold
and crimson light; or, as the light grows dimmer, shrouded in deep
purple shadow till they disappear in the gloom which quickly falls
on all.</p>

<p>Westward from this great mountain plateau, and divided from it
by a broad deep valley clothed with forests, the huge mountain of
Pertâbgurh rises with precipitous sides out of the woods and ravines
below. The top, irregularly level, furnished space for dwelling-houses
and magazines, while ample springs of pure water sufficed
for the use of a large body of men, by which it could be easily defended.
At various periods of time&mdash;by the early Mahratta chieftains
of the country in remote ages, and afterwards by their Mussulman
conquerors&mdash;walls and towers had been added to the natural defences<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
of the place, as well as strong gateways, protected by bastions and
loopholed traverses, on the only approach to the summit&mdash;a rugged
pathway, which could hardly be called a road. Under very ordinary
defence, the place was perfectly impregnable to all attacks by an
enemy from without; and, at the period of our tale, it was held as
his capital and choicest stronghold, among many such fastnesses in
those mountains, by Sivaji Bhóslay, a man destined to play a conspicuous
part in the history of his country and people in particular,
and of India at large.</p>

<p>We have already informed the reader, in a somewhat desultory
manner perhaps, for we are not writing his history, of the attempts
made by Sivaji to establish an independent power; and, by taking
advantage of the weakness and distraction of the kingdom of Beejapoor,
of which he was a vassal, on the one hand, and of the ambitious
designs of the Emperor Aurungzeeb on the other, to raise
himself to a position in which he could secure the actual administration,
and eventually the sovereignty, of his native wilds.</p>

<p>Hindu history is in all cases unsatisfactory; and that of the early
Mahratta chiefs and principalities of the Dekhan eminently so. On
the invasion of the Dekhan by Alla-oo-deen, nephew of the then
King of Delhi, in <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 1294, the fort and city of Deogurh, now
Doulatabad, was held by Rajah Ramdeo Jadow, who appeared then
to have been prince of the whole country. Whether he was so or
not, whether the chiefs of the wild tracts of the Ghauts and provinces
lying on the western sea-coast were his tributaries or vassals,
or whether they were actually independent of each other, has never
been ascertained; but, on the downfall of the princely house of
Jadow, no other ruler or chieftain seems to have made any resistance,
and the Mahomedans, gathering strength, and founding a kingdom
at Gulburgah, in the centre of the Dekhan, gradually subdued the
whole tract, establishing garrisons in the wildest parts, fortifying
hills not already used as strongholds, and improving the defences of
others, in that noble and picturesque style of fortification which
now excites our wonder and admiration.</p>

<p>One of the Mahratta families of ancient native nobility, though
not of the highest grade, were the Bhóslays. The Jadows, though
no longer possessing princely power, had descended into the rank of
landed proprietors, or hereditary officers, under the ancient Hindu
tenure, of the districts over which their ancestors had once held
sway. Under ordinary circumstances, an alliance between the
families would have been rejected by the Jadows; but one fell out
nevertheless, and after a strange manner.</p>

<p>At the marriage of a mutual friend, Shahji Bhóslay, then a pretty
boy, was present with his father, and the head of the family of the
Jadows with his daughter, Jeejee, a child younger than the boy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
Shahji. The children began to play together, and the girl's father
remarked jocosely what a pretty couple they would make. The
remark was heard by the boy's father, who claimed it as a promise
of betrothal, and, after some discussion, and objection as to disparity
of rank, the children were eventually married. From these parents
sprung Sivaji, who, with his mother, as remarkable a person in
many respects as himself, became the originators and leaders of the
renewed independence of the Hindus of the Dekhan.</p>

<p>The women of India, particularly those of the higher classes and
families, are invariably the treasuries of family events, and of deeds
of departed or existent greatness. Jeejee Bye, an ambitious, perhaps
unscrupulous woman, strove hard to excite her husband, Shahji
Bhóslay, to exertion in the Hindu cause. She filled his mind with
legends of the Jadows' power; she sought out the histories of his
own family; she urged him to assert his right to districts in
sovereignty of which he was only the official head; and she actively
canvassed all the heads of the Mahratta families, with a view to a
combined resistance against the Mahomedan powers, then beginning
to show symptoms of a final decadence.</p>

<p>And not without effect. Shahji, the servant and vassal of the
Emperor of Delhi as of the King of Beejapoor, rebelled in turn
against both; was restless and unfaithful, lacking, while a bold,
enterprising partisan soldier, the higher qualities which could direct
and take advantage of such movements. He was frequently imprisoned,
fined, and otherwise punished, but nothing checked his
wife's ambition. Left to herself during his long absences and captivities
with her young son among their native wilds, surrounded by
rude retainers, she turned to him as soon as he could comprehend
her plans; and by the mother and son those designs were sketched
out which, in respect of utter hopelessness at first, and splendid
success afterwards, have few comparisons in the world's history.</p>

<p>As the boy grew up, his immediate retainers joined him in wild
enterprises against the Mahomedans, which to the people savoured
of madness, but which, as they increased in boldness of design and
execution, were believed to be the deeds of one especially protected
by the Goddess Bhowani, the tutelar divinity of the Jadow family.
His mother, an ardent votary, pretended to be occasionally visited
by the goddess in person, and, filled with her divine afflatus, spoke
prophecy. Her son believed in her inspiration: and gradually his
friends, Maloosray, Palkur, and others, with a superstitious faith,
believed also. Undisciplined, often unarmed men of the Mawuls,
or mountain valleys above the Ghauts, who were called Mawullees,
and of those below the mountains towards the sea, called Hetkurees,
joined the young leader: scaled mountain forts, or descended into
the plains beyond the valleys, gathering arms and booty, occupying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
Moslem garrisons, putting their defenders to the sword, and never
relinquishing what they had obtained.</p>

<p>So year after year passed, and the young Sivaji, as he grew
stronger, became more daring and enterprising. Originally a few
hundreds of half-naked, ill-armed mountain peasants, his forces of
Mawullees and Hetkurees at last numbered many thousands of active,
determined men. He had possession of some of the strongest
mountain forts in the Western Ghauts; he had built, and was building,
defences to other isolated and naturally almost inaccessible
mountains. He was arming them with cannon purchased by stealth
from the Portuguese of Goa, or cast by his own skilful artificers;
and as he gained more perfect local strength, he was silently extending
his intrigues to all the Mahratta families of ancient Maharástra
by agents like Moro Trimmul, and awaiting the time patiently, till
all could rise to overthrow the Mussulman governments which held
them in subjection.</p>

<p>Had those governments, after the spirit of the earlier Mussulman
invaders of the Dekhan, been intolerant of Hindus, denied them
privileges of worship, defiled their temples, confiscated their ancestral
rights, or otherwise harassed and oppressed them,&mdash;it is probable
that Shahji's first attempts towards throwing off the Mahomedan
yoke would have met with better success. But, on the contrary,
there was now little or no oppression or interference with them in
any way; and many of the Mahratta chieftains not only held estates
in fief for service, but joined the armies of the Mahomedan kings,
and fought with them bravely and faithfully. We have ourselves a
counterpart of this, in some respects, in the Norman occupation of
our own country; inasmuch as, while some Saxon thanes then held
themselves aloof, and retired to the management of their own estates,
others were found who joined the invaders, or, gradually imitating
their manners, became incorporated with them.</p>

<p>That Sivaji's prospects had assumed a more encouraging form
than any of his father's, may easily be imagined from the method in
which they had been maintained. The Dusséra, or festival of
Bhowani, throughout Maharástra, of 1657, the year of which we
write, was to show, by a private muster of the people, what forces
were available for a general rising; and after that it would be
determined how they were to be employed.</p>

<p>We know what the object of Maloosray's mission to Beejapoor
had been, and its result. Sivaji had heard already by express from
the capital, of the death of the Wuzeer, the discovery of some of his
own correspondence by the King, and the acceptance of the gage
by Afzool Khan to undertake a campaign against him with a picked
army. He had not heard since, nor had Maloosray arrived; but
Sivaji knew that Afzool Khan was no laggard in war, and that he
must prepare himself to meet the emergency.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span></p>

<p>A fascination for sacred plays which had possessed him from
childhood, was a strange peculiarity of this man's character. As
Sivaji grew up, no distance, no personal danger, deterred him from
being present at any which could by any possibility be reached.
Sometimes openly, and more frequently in a peasant's or common
soldier's garb, the young prince, with a few chosen associates, would
appear at places where his arrival was incomprehensible, and his
disappearance equally abrupt and mysterious. In the latter days,
these "Kuthas," as they are termed, became means of assembling
his men without attracting suspicion; but his adherents well knew
that the most exciting enterprises immediately followed them.</p>

<p>Soon after the arrival of the news from Beejapoor, notice of one
to be held at Pertâbgurh had been sent through the country, and
from the earnestness and celerity with which the orders were circulated
from village to village, the people at large were assured of
the proximity of some notable event, and hoped, in their own expressive
phrase, that, at last, the "fire would light the hills."</p>

<p>With this partial digression, and introduction to the Rajah's play,
the day of which had arrived, our history will proceed.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_LXX" id="CHAPTER_LXX">CHAPTER LXX.</a></h2>


<p>From a straggling, irregular village, which could hardly be called a
town, nestling in a hollow under the mountain of Pertâbgurh, a rude
pathway, for it was little else, ascended to the fort above. Very
rough, but very lovely, was this road. The forest, or jungle, had
been partly cleared away from its sides, but noble trees still hung
over it, affording grateful shade as it wound round ravines and
shoulders of the mountain in gradual but easy ascent; and the huge
broad leaf of the teak tree, the graceful and feathery bamboo, and
other masses of luxuriant foliage, rich with great creepers now
covered with flowers, which hung from tree to tree in graceful
festoons, or clung in dense masses about their tops,&mdash;presented endless
and beautiful combinations with the bold upper precipices of the
mountain itself, and the distant ranges behind it. Farther up, as
the air grew fresher in the ascent, and you looked down into deep
gloomy dells, or abroad over the valley, or up to the rugged sides of
the great mountain beyond,&mdash;a subtle blue atmosphere appeared to
pervade everything; and this, the peculiar characteristic of those
high tropical regions, seemed to increase in depth of colour,&mdash;and,
without in reality obscuring the features of the scenery, to soften its
rugged outlines, and blend its almost savage elements into harmony.</p>

<p>It has been said of natives of India that they are insensible to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
beauties of natural scenery. We admit that Mussulmans to a great
extent are so, but not Hindus, still less Mahrattas, of these glorious
mountains. Their sacred books, their ballads, and recited plays,
abound with beautiful pictures of natural objects; and, living among
combinations of the most glorious forms in nature, peopling every
remarkable rock, deep dell, or giant tree with spiritual beings
belonging peculiarly to each, who are worshipped with a rude veneration,&mdash;insensibility
to outward impressions and their influence
upon character would be impossible.</p>

<p>So now, at the time we speak of, a numerous company of men on
foot were ascending by the pathway already mentioned to the fort,
and that light merriment prevailed among them which ever accompanies
the enjoyment of fine scenery and pure mountain air, and
excites physical capability for the endurance of the heaviest fatigue.
Some ran or leaped, as occasional level portions of road occurred;
others climbed among the crags and rocks by its side, or, knowing
shorter paths to the summit, struck out of the main road, and
breasted the steep mountain with a freedom and agility only known
to mountaineers.</p>

<p>Keen-eyed, lithe, spare, yet muscular men; low in stature, yet of
extraordinary power of endurance; often heavily armed with long
matchlock, and its accompaniment of powder-horns, bullet-bags, and
other accoutrements tied round the waist,&mdash;a long, straight, heavy
two-handled sword hanging over the left shoulder, or a smaller
curved sabre fastened into the waist-band, with a dagger or two, and
a broad shield at the back&mdash;such were Sivaji's Mawullees. Ordinarily
unburdened with much clothing&mdash;a pair of drawers fitting
tight below the knee, a coarse handkerchief wound about the
head, and a black blanket thrown over all, or crossed over the chest,
leaving the arms free, sufficed for ordinary purposes; on festival
days, however, all were clad in a clean suit of coarse cotton cloth,
with a gay turban, and scarf round the waist, and bunches of wild
flowers tucked fantastically into the folds of their head-dress.</p>

<p>This was a festival day&mdash;for their Rajah had ordered a Kutha;
and all knew when this took place that it was the prelude to some
raid or foray&mdash;some distant expedition in which honour and booty
were to be gained&mdash;and when the Mawullees would strike in, hard
and fierce, on the unsuspecting Moslems. The "Dhunni," or master,
as they called him, had been unaccountably quiet for some time past;
but to a man they knew he was not idle, and throughout that
country, as in more remote provinces, the conviction prevailed that
something unusual was to happen&mdash;some manifestation of the will
of the goddess, whom all feared and most worshipped. There was
nothing apparent or tangible; but expectation and excitement
prevailed nevertheless.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span></p>

<p>For several days previously, the usual messengers had run from
village to village among the Mawuls or valleys of the ranges near
Pertâbgurh, giving news of the Kutha. The players had come from
Wye, from Sattara, and other towns, and the Rajah's hill-men had
been clearing the usual place of celebration, and were now decorating
the royal seat, and stage for the players, with green boughs and
wild flowers. The little town was already full of people, and others
were crowding up the mountain to make their salutation to their
beloved prince who, now seated in his hall of audience, surrounded
by a few friends, soldiers, and priests, denied no one the privilege so
dearly prized, that of making a "salam" to their Rajah, and receiving
one in return.</p>

<p>Up the mountain-side, through the grim gateways, till they
emerged upon the irregular plateau at the top, the men poured in a
continuous stream. Some singly or in small groups; others in larger
companies headed by a pair of "gursees," or pipers, one playing a
drone, the other a reed flageolet, very strong and shrill in tone, the
combination of which, as well as the wild melodies played, being
curiously like bagpipes in effect. Others had with them their village
trumpeters; and shrill quivering blasts of their horns, accompanied
by the deep monotonous notes of large tambourine drums, not unfrequently
arose together or singly from different parts of the ascent,
and were answered by the Rajah's horn-blowers stationed on the
bastions above the gates, and elsewhere in the towers above the
precipices. The fort was full of men, for several thousands were
assembled in it: sitting in groups, rambling about the walls, or by
the side of springs and wells, untying the bundles of cakes which
each man had bound to his back, and making a noonday meal; or
proceeding to their chieftain's kitchen, received the daily allowance
of meal bread, which was served out without stint to all comers on
those occasions, and of which huge piles stood on the kitchen floor
ready for distribution.</p>

<p>All the morning Sivaji had sat in his humble hall of audience,
surrounded by some of his tried friends, and some Brahmun priests
and scribes. No gorgeous palace was this, like that at Beejapoor, but
a broad shed made by poles fastened together, and thatched with
grass and teak-leaves, decorated gracefully and appropriately with
leafy branches and wild flowers. At the upper end was the Rajah's
seat, a low dais covered with coarse cotton carpets, on which the
"guddee" or royal seat&mdash;a velvet pillow covered with gold embroidery,
and a seat to match&mdash;had been placed temporarily. Below
the dais, the leaders of large and small parties of men came&mdash;saluted&mdash;seated
themselves by turns, and got up and departed with the
usual salutation, but seldom without notice; and while other men
passed quickly by, the chief had a kind word of greeting or reminiscence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
or salute for every one. Many saw that his features were
clouded with care; but the news from the capital concerned no one,
and the Kutha to come off that night would, they knew, prove the
usual prelude of active service.</p>

<p>Seated as he was amidst a crowd of friends and attendants, the
Mahratta Rajah seemed, in the distance, almost contemptible, from
his small stature and plain, insignificant appearance. Dressed in
ordinary white muslin, the only ornament he wore was the "jika,"
or jewel for the turban, which sparkled with valuable diamonds. A
light red shawl drawn over his shoulders protected him from the
somewhat chill wind, and before him lay his terrible sword Bhowani,
and the large black shield of rhinoceros hide which he usually wore.
A nearer view, however, gave a different impression. Somewhat
dark in complexion, with a prominent nose, broad in the nostril;
large, soft eyes, small determined mouth and chin; a thin moustache
curled up at the ends, and bushy black whiskers shaved on a line
with his ear,&mdash;formed a countenance at once handsome and intelligent:
while his slight figure, apparently more active than strong,
evinced, by its lithe movement even while sitting, a power of endurance
which was confirmed by the expression of his face.</p>

<p>No one who had once seen the Maharaja ever forgot him. Though
now mild in expression, if not sad, most about him had seen and
remembered the face in other and wilder moods of excitement: in
war, or in the actual hand-to-hand combats, in which he delighted,
and from which he could with difficulty be restrained; while the
impression that he was an incarnation of divinity, mingled awe with
the respect and love which all bore him.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_LXXI" id="CHAPTER_LXXI">CHAPTER LXXI.</a></h2>


<p>The morning ceremony was at length over, and, somewhat wearied
by it, and by sitting inactive so long, Sivaji rose and passed into
his private apartments, to which the shed or pavilion was a temporary
addition. The rough mountain fortress afforded no royal
palaces. A few terraced houses, divided by courts, with some
thatched out-offices and stables, stood on an elevated spot near the
walls; and the Rajah's favourite retreat was a small vaulted apartment,
which joined the fort-wall&mdash;indeed, formed portion of it&mdash;and
from which a small projecting window, placed immediately above
one of the deepest precipices, looked out over the valley and mountains,
and commanded a view of part of the ascent.</p>

<p>It was a habit of Sivaji's to go to no ceremony, nor return from
any, without saluting his mother. Did he ever leave the house or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
return to it, he touched her feet reverently, while she gave him her
blessing. The son's faith in his mother was only equalled by her
faith and love for him; and as a pattern of filial piety and devotion,
his example is still inculculated upon the Mahratta youth by many
a village schoolmaster.</p>

<p>She met him at the threshold of the door, and, as was her wont,
passed her hands over his face and neck, kissing the tips of her
fingers; while, bowing low, he touched both her feet, then his own
eyes and forehead.</p>

<p>"Is Tannajee arrived, son," she asked, "that thou hast broken up
the reception so early?"</p>

<p>"No, mother," he said; "but come with me, for my spirit is heavy,
and there is a shadow of gloom over me which thou only canst
dispel. No, there is no news, and that vexes me."</p>

<p>She followed him into the apartment we have mentioned. A plain
cushion had been placed near the window upon a soft mattress, and
he flung, rather than seated himself, upon it, and buried his face in
his hands, turning away from her.</p>

<p>She sat down by him, and again passed her hand over his face
and neck, and kissed her fingers without speaking.</p>

<p>A mother's loving hand! O ye who know it, who possess it as
the rude waves of life come breaking one by one against you, be
thankful that it is there in its old place, soothing and sustaining
like nought else of earthly comfort! Ye who have lost it, never
forget how lovingly it used to do its blessed work. In times of
anxious trial, perplexity, and sickness most of all,&mdash;ye shall feel it
still, in the faith which leads ye where it is gone before, and awaits
your coming. So, forget it not!&mdash;forget it not!</p>

<p>For a while both were silent. The mother knew the feelings which
filled her son's mind too well to interfere with their course. Still
she sat by him, and patted him occasionally as she used to do when
she soothed him to rest as a child. "If he could sleep," she thought,
"this gloom would pass away; but it will do so nevertheless."</p>

<p>He lay still, sometimes looking out into the blue air, watching the
swallows as they passed and repassed the window in rapid flight to
and from their nests, which hung to the ledges of the precipices&mdash;or
the groups of people ascending and descending the pathway to
the gates. Again, burying his face in the cushion, he lay still, and
his mother watched, and gently waved the corner of her garment
over his head, lest any insect should light on him and disturb him.
There was no sound save the dull buzzing of flies in the room, and
sometimes the loud monotonous note of a great woodpecker from
the depths of the ravine below.</p>

<p>He turned at length, and she knew the crisis was past. "Mother,"
he said, "hast thou been with the goddess to-day? To me she is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
dim and mournful; I ask my heart of her designs, but there comes
no answer. Is her favour gone from us?"</p>

<p>"Who can tell her purposes, my life?" she replied, "we are only
her instruments. O, fail not in heart! If there be troubles, should
we not meet them? If she bid us suffer, shall we not suffer? But,
O, fail not&mdash;doubt not! Remember thy father doubted and failed,
and what came of it but weary imprisonment, fine, pain, shame,
and failure? O, not so, my son: better thou wast dead, and I with
thee, than to doubt and fail."</p>

<p>"The trial will be heavy, mother," he returned. "Here we are safe,
and I fear not for thee: but for the rest, the cause is hopeless, and
that is what vexes me. Years of stratagem and arrangement are
gone with that man's death, and all we have planned is known."</p>

<p>"And if it be known, son, dost thou fear?" she exclaimed.
"What has been gained by these communications with a traitor?
O son, he who is not faithful to the salt he eats, is untrue to all
besides. I&mdash;a woman only&mdash;and the priests will tell thee not to
trust a woman's thoughts or designs&mdash;I tell thee I am glad: I rejoice
that a trial has come to thee. One hour such as thou hast passed
now, with thine own heart to speak to thee, is worth more to the
cause than a thousand priests or a lakh of swordsmen. I tell thee I
am glad: for such things only can teach thee to trust thyself, and
not to look to others."</p>

<p>"And thee, mother?" he said, smiling.</p>

<p>"No, no&mdash;not to me," she replied quickly, "except the goddess
speaks by my mouth. No, not to me. I am but a woman else, fearful
of thee, my son&mdash;fearful of the bullet, the sword, the lance, the
wild fray of battle&mdash;fearful of&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nay, mother," he cried, sitting up and interrupting her, "not
of the sword or the battle; there I am safe,&mdash;there I fear not.
Were I but there now, this heaviness at my heart would pass away.
'Hur, Hur, Mahadeo!' the cry&mdash;the shout rings in my ears and
urges me on; then there is no time for thought, as now in this
silence."</p>

<p>"And it shall ring again, my son," she replied. "Fear not&mdash;doubt
not, only act: that is all. Wilt thou be like thy father,
drifted here and there by every current of rumour like a straw upon
the sea? 'Such a one will not join, what can I do? Such a thing
threatens, what can I do? This man says this, shall I follow it?
That man says the other, shall I follow it?' So he followed as others
led; so he acted as others advised. What came of all? only shame,
my son. Had he said to all, Do this, they would have done it. O
Mother, O Holy Mother," she cried, standing up and lifting her
joined hands towards the deep blue sky, "come from thence&mdash;come
from the air into thy daughter's heart; teach me what to say, how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
to direct him, or direct him thyself! O Mother, we do all for thy
name and honour, and for the faith so long degraded: let us not fail
or be shamed!</p>

<p>"Not thus, son," she continued after a pause&mdash;"not thus will the
spirit come upon me, but in the temple must I watch alone and pray
and fast, ere she will disclose herself to me; and I will do so from
to-night. Yes, she will be entreated at last. Perhaps," she continued
simply, but reverently, "the Mother is in sorrow herself, and
needs comfort. No matter, I will entreat her."</p>

<p>"Surely she hath heard already," replied her son after another
pause, "for my soul is better for thy words&mdash;stronger, mother. Yes,
I see how it will be; nor Moro Trimmul, nor Tannajee, nor Palkur,
nor any one but myself. I had thought to lay all these matters
before the people at the Kutha to-night, but I will not. I will only
say we must work for ourselves&mdash;against the Emperor, against the
King, and most against Afzool Khan. If they will only trust in me&mdash;yes,
mother, if they will only trust in me&mdash;we shall have victory,
and I will not disappoint them or you."</p>

<p>"Now, a thousand blessings on thee, Sivaji Bhóslay, for those
words," cried his mother, passing her hands over his head. "I have
no fear now&mdash;none. Go to the Kutha&mdash;tell them all that their time
is come; and when you cry 'Hur, Hur, Mahadeo!' each shout of
theirs in reply will echo the death-cry of a thousand infidels. Now,
let me depart, my son; it is well for me to go to the Mother, and
sit before her; haply she may come to me. Better to be there, than
that a woman should be near thee, when the woman's spirit has
passed out of thee."</p>

<p>"Bless me, then, my mother, and go; nor will I stay here long,"
he replied. "The shadows are even now lengthening in the valleys,
and I should have the people collected ere it is dark."</p>

<p>She placed her hands upon his head solemnly: "Thus do I bless
thee, my son&mdash;more fervently, more resignedly than ever. Go,
as she will lead thee in her own time. To all thy people thou wilt
not alter, but, to the Moslems, be stone and steel. Trust no one&mdash;ask
of no one what is to be done, not even of me. Do what is
needful, and what thy heart tells thee. Show no mercy, but
cut out thine own path with the sword. If thou wilt be great, do
these things; if not&mdash;&mdash;: but no, thou wilt be great, my son. She
hath told me so; and thou wilt reckon the true beginning of it from
that silent watch there, by the window. I go now, but stay not
thou here. See, there are none ascending, and even those descending
the hill are fewer. Go to them."</p>

<p>He watched her intently as she left him and disappeared behind a
curtain, which fell before a door of the apartment leading to the
small household temple. An expression of triumph lit up his large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
dark eyes and expressive features. "She said I must act for myself,"
he cried aloud. "Yes, mother, I will act for thee first, and then for
the people; and there shall be no idle words again&mdash;only 'Hur, Hur,
Mahadeo!' when the fire is on the hills."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_LXXII" id="CHAPTER_LXXII">CHAPTER LXXII.</a></h2>


<p>The servants and attendants of the lady awaited her without, and
preceded her to the temple, which was situated in a court by itself,&mdash;a
small unpretending building, which her son had built at her
request. The usual priests sat by the shrine, feeding the lamps with
oil, and offering flowers and incense for those who needed their
services. This, too, had been a busy day for them, for the Rajah's
temple had been opened to those who came to the fort; and many a
humble offering and donation of copper coins to the priests, from
the soldiery, had been the result. The court had now been cleared
of all visitors, and the doors shut. As the lady advanced and sat
down before the shrine, the priests made the customary libations and
offerings, and stood apart, not daring to speak, for her visions of the
goddess were well known, and much feared, and this might be the
occasion of one of them. So, as she sat down, the priests and her
attendants shrank back behind the entrance to the sanctum, and
awaited the issue in silence.</p>

<p>Very different from Tara, as she had sunk down in her strange
delirium before the shrine at Tooljapoor, the Máhá Ranee, as she was
called, but more simply and lovingly the "Lady Mother," was perfectly
calm and self-possessed. A small, grey-headed, slightly-formed
woman, of graceful carriage and shape, which had altered
little, if at all, from the best period of her youth: nor, except in her
hair, had age apparently told much upon her: for the arms were still
as round, the skin of her cheek as soft and downy as ever, and the firm
springy tread of the small naked foot showed no decline of vigour.
Her son often told her she was yet the most beautiful woman in
Maharástra; nor indeed, in the clear golden olive of her skin, in the
delicate mould and sweet expressive character of her features, above
all, in the soft lustre of her eyes, had she many rivals.</p>

<p>She had seated herself directly before the shrine, on which was a
small gold image of the goddess upon a golden pedestal; and the
water-vessels, lamps, and other articles of service were also of gold.
The full light of the lamps within shone out on her, and glistened on
the white silk garment she wore, with its broad crimson and gold
border&mdash;upon the jewelled bracelets on her arms&mdash;and the large pearls
about her neck. The end of her saree, heavy with gold thread, had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
fallen a little aside as she seated herself, and her soft throat, and a
little of the crimson silk bodice below, could be seen&mdash;enough to
show that if the face were calm, the bosom was heaving rapidly, and
under the influence of no common emotion. No one dared to speak
to her, or interrupt her thoughts or prayers, whatever they might
be; and when she seated herself before the shrine in this manner,
the priests and attendants knew she expected a "revelation," and
had to wait, even though it might be for many hours, for the issue.</p>

<p>When it came, it was with various effect. At times calm, with
glistening eyes and throbbing bosom, her hands clenched convulsively,
she would speak strange words, which were heard with a
mysterious reverence, and recorded by an attendant priest; at others,
the result was wild delirium, when they were obliged to hold her,
and when the excitement was followed by exhaustion, which remained
for days.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Now, however, she sat calmly, her eyes cast
down, but raised occasionally with an imploring look to the image,
seldom altering her position, and seemingly unconscious of the time
which passed.</p>

<p>Long she sat there; the shadows of the mountains lengthened,
till only their peaks shone like fire, and then suddenly died out.
The moon rose, and the little court was white under her silver beams,
and still the lady sat and moved not. The chill night breeze at that
elevation had caused an involuntary shiver to pass over her, which
her favourite attendant thought was the precursor of the usual
affection, but nothing followed; and seeing it was caused by cold,
had, apparently unobserved, cast over her a large red shawl, which
fell in soft folds round her person. It was far in the night when
she arose from that strange vigil; and, dreamily passing her hands
over her face and neck as if to arouse herself, sighed, and advancing
to the threshold of the shrine, joined her hands together, and bowing
reverently before the image, saluted it, and silently turned away.</p>

<p>"Not to-night, Bheemee," she said to a woman who approached
her bearing her sandals, and laid them down at the entrance to the
temple,&mdash;"not to-night. The Mother bids me go; she is sad, and will
come another time. Hark! what is what?" and she paused to listen.</p>

<p>A hoarse roar, a cry as though of a wail of thousands of voices,
came from all sides at once, floating up the precipices, echoed from
the rocks, and reverberating from mountain to mountain. It seemed
to those present, who were already filled with superstitious expectation,
as if spirits cried out, being invisible, and that some unearthly
commotion was in progress around them. In the pure mountain air,
still as it was, these sounds seemed to float about them mysteriously,
now dying away, and now returning more faintly than before, till
they ceased, or only a confused perception of them remained. The
fierce shout or wail, however, occurred but once; what followed
was more diffuse and undecided.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span></p>
<p>"Something has moved the people more than ordinarily, lady,"
said a priest who advanced from the outer court. "The assembly
can be seen from the bastion yonder, and I have been watching it
while you were within; if you would look, follow me."</p>

<p>She drew the shawl more closely around her, and went with him
through the court to the bastion, which, situated on the edge of an
angle of the precipice, commanded a view of the town and valley
below. The moon shone clear and bright, else she had looked into
a black void; but the air was soft and white, of a tint like opal, as
the moon's rays caught the thin vapours now rising. Some thousands
of feet below, was a bright spot in a dell, filled with torches,
which sent up a dull smoke, while they diffused a bright light on all
around. There were many thousands of people there, mostly men,
and there was a glitter as of weapons among them, as the masses
still heaved and swayed under the influence of some strange excitement.
She could make out no particular forms, but she knew that
her son sat in the pavilion at the end, and about that there was no
movement. As she looked, the shout they had first heard arose
more clearly than before&mdash;"Hur, Hur, Mahadeo! Dônguras-lavilé
Déva!"<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>"O Mother," she cried, stretching out her arms to the sky, and
then to the dell below, "enough! thou hast heard the prayer of thy
daughter: thou wast there with him, not with me. Now I understand,
and it is enough. Come, Bheemee, it is cold," she said, after
a pause, and in her usual cheerful voice, "thou shouldst have been
yonder in the Kutha, girl, and all of you. Well, the next, to-morrow
night, will be a better one, and you shall all go, for I will go myself
with the Maharaja; come now, they will not return till daylight;"
and descending the steps of the bastion, she followed her servants,
who preceded her, to the private apartments.</p>

<p>Below, Sivaji had been busy since before sunset. He had descended
the mountain on foot, attended by his body-guard, and a
large company of the garrison of the fort&mdash;a gay procession, as,
accompanied by the pipers and horn-blowers of the fortress, it had
wound down the rugged pathway in the full glare of the evening
sun; and, amidst the shouts of thousands, and a confused and
hideous clangour, caused by the independent performances of all the
pipers and drummers of the clans assembled&mdash;the screaming, quivering
notes of the long village horns, the clash of cymbals, and the
deep tones of some of the large brass trumpets belonging to the
temple, which had been brought down from the fort,&mdash;Sivaji passed on
round the village to the spot which had been cleared for the Kutha.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span></p>
<p>It was a glen from which all wood had long been cleared away,
and short crisp grass had grown up in its place, which, moistened
by the perpetual drainage of the mountain, was always close and
verdant. Near enough to the village to serve as a grazing ground
for its cattle, the herbage was kept short by them; and the passage
round and round its sides of beasts of all kinds, goats and sheep,
cows, bullocks, and buffaloes, had worn them into paths which
formed, as it were, a series of steps, rising gradually to the edge of
the forest above.</p>

<p>In the midst was a bright green sward, soft and close, and of
some extent, and at all times of the year the resort of the village youth
for athletic exercises&mdash;wrestling, leaping, archery, shooting with
the matchlock, or, most favoured of all perhaps, the sword-playing
for which the Mahratta soldiery were almost celebrated. A projecting
mound, which might have been artificial, and was possibly
the partly completed embankment of some intended reservoir,
stretched nearly across its mouth, and while its grassy surface
afforded seats to many of the spectators, it shut out the valley
beyond, from all observers.</p>

<p>At the upper end of the dell, which in shape was a long oval, and
slightly raised above the level sward, was the Rajah's seat, a platform
of sods and earth, covered with dry grass, and then with
carpets from the fort, upon which the Guddee, or seat of state, was
placed. Directly the Rajah had retired from the morning ceremony,
the cushions had been taken down the mountain and placed
on this dais, which afforded room also for many personal friends
and priests who attended the ceremony with him.</p>

<p>In the centre of the sward, but near the upper end, was the place
for the players. The smoothest portion of turf had been selected,
and around it wattled screens were built, made of leafy branches,
for entrance and exit, and also to allow of changes of dress, rest
during intervals of performance, and the like. The stage, if it
might be called one, was bounded by wild plantain trees cut off at
the root, and set in the ground so that the broad leaves continued
fresh and green; and above these were twined branches of teak
with their large rough foliage, bamboos, and other slender trees
readily felled and transported, while long masses of flowery creepers
had been cut from the forest, and hung from poles at each side
above the players' heads in graceful festoons. Inside all this
foliage, were huge cressets of iron filled with cotton-seed soaked in
oil, and all round the area below, and especially round the Rajah's
seat, similar torches had been arranged, which would be lighted as
the ceremony began, and illuminate the whole.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span></p>

<p>Before the stage, there was a small altar of earth, on which
brightly polished brass vessels for pouring libations were set out,
and above them, upon a silver pedestal, a small silver image of the
goddess had been placed for worship.</p>

<p>Early in the afternoon, people had begun to assemble there, and
after the Rajah's arrival in the town, a new procession was formed
to accompany him to the place. Thousands had rushed on before
it; along the valley, over the shoulders of the mountain, and as best
they could, so as to secure good places for the sight; and by the
time the head of the procession crossed the little brook which bubbled
out beneath the mound, and ran leaping and tinkling down the
valley, and had entered the glen,&mdash;the whole of its sides and the
mound had grown into a dense mass of human beings closely packed
together. There were comparatively few women; those who sat
there were for the most part the Rajah's Mawullees and Hetkurees,
armed as if for battle, ready, if needed, to march thence on any
enterprise, however distant or desperate.</p>

<p>A clear space had been left for the advancing procession. In
front the Rajah's pipers, playing some of the wild mountain melodies,
which echoed among the woods and crags above, broken now and
then by blasts of horns and trumpets, and the deep monotonous beat
of many large tambourine drums, the bearers of which were marshalled
by the chief drummer of the fort, who, with his instrument
decked with flowers and silken streamers, strutted or leaped in front
of all, beating a wild march. Then followed Brahmuns, bare-headed
and naked to the waist, carrying bright copper vessels of sacred
water, flowers and incense, with holy fire from the temple on the
mountain, chanting hymns at intervals. After them, the players
and reciters, male and female, in fantastic dresses, wearing gilt
tiaras to resemble the costumes seen in carvings of ancient temples,
among whom were the jesters or clowns, who bandied bold and free
remarks with the crowd, and provoked many a hearty laugh and
sharp retort. After these the Rajah's own guard, some with sword
and buckler only, others bearing matchlocks with long bright
barrels, who marched in rows with somewhat of military organization;
then the servants; and last of all Sivaji himself. Slowly the
procession passed up the centre; then the leading portions of it
dividing on each hand, the Rajah, advancing, mounted the small
platform. Ere he seated himself he saluted the assembly, turning
to each side of it with his hand raised to his head, and all rose to
welcome him with clapping of hands and shouts which made the
wooded glen and the precipices above, ring with the joyous sound.
Then all subsided into their seats, and the preliminary sacrifices
and offerings began.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_LXXIII" id="CHAPTER_LXXIII">CHAPTER LXXIII.</a></h2>


<p>We need not describe them. After the sacrifice of several sheep
before the altar, to propitiate the goddess in the form of worship
peculiar to lower castes, the Brahmuns continued the rest of the
ceremonies. Here were the same recitations of religious books, the
Shastras and Poorans; the same processions sweeping round the altar
with offerings, and hymns chanted by the priests at stated periods;
the same invocations of the deity to be present, as we have already
seen in the temple at Tooljapoor; and as they proceeded, shadows
lengthened, the sun disappeared behind the mountains, and gloom
fell rapidly on the glen and its people.</p>

<p>Very soon, however, it was lighted up; men bearing huge copper
vessels of oil on their shoulders, went round the area pouring cans
full upon the cotton-seed in the iron cressets, and then lighting
them, and a blaze arose from each which illuminated a large space
around. Gradually the whole were lit; and the effect was as strange
as beautiful.</p>

<p>Tier upon tier of closely-wedged human beings, whose white
dresses and gay turbans and scarves appeared even brighter by night
than by day, arose on all sides, those nearest the light being clearly
seen, while the others, rising gradually to the top, were less and less
distinct, till they seemed to blend with the fringe of wood above,
and disappear in the gloom. Below, about the place of performance,
and around the Rajah's seat, the illumination was brightest; and the
thick smoke of incense rising from the altar hung over all like a
canopy, diffusing its fragrance to the farthest edges of the assembly.
Above, the grim mountain precipices hung threateningly over all,
fringed at the top by walls and towers, hardly perceptible in the distance,
except where they projected against the sky; and on which,
and on the woods, as the night advanced, the bright light of the
moon fell with a silvery lustre which our northern climate does not
know.</p>

<p>To act a Hindu play is by no means so simple a matter as to act
an English one. It frequently lasts several days. On this present
occasion it would occupy three nights. There was the introduction,
the middle, and the catastrophe. There would be pleasant witty
interludes of broad farce between the scenes, acted by the clowns in
various characters; satires upon Brahmuns, and priests generally,
being a favourite subject: upon landlords and tenants: upon servants
and masters: upon lovers&mdash;merchants&mdash;in short, upon all social
topics. There would be political satires also; and the Rajah would
see himself represented according to the popular belief, whatever it
might be, flatteringly or the contrary, and would take the joke good-humouredly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span></p>

<p>So the entertainment proceeded. We, who sit for an hour or two
with a languid indifference, or real approbation, as it may be, of
theatrical representation here, can hardly appreciate the intense
absorption of a Mahratta audience at one of their religious plays,
where gods and demigods, represented by clever players and singers,
engage in earthly struggles of love or war, and evince human sympathies
and passions. So hour after hour passed, and Rajah and
people alike sat and listened and watched; now to a grand scene
from the Mahabarut or Ramayun; now to a merry farce, or description
by the "chorus" of what was to come next; now to a plaintive
mountain ballad introduced into the general performance.</p>

<p>It was near midnight, perhaps, when a single horseman suddenly
turned the corner of the mound, and, entering the area unperceived,
where it was not crowded, rode slowly up the centre. His noble
horse seemed jaded and weary, for it moved languidly, yet, when it
saw the lights and people, raised its head and gave a shrill and prolonged
neigh. Its flanks were smoking, and its coat a mass of foam,
proving that it had been ridden hard and fast.</p>

<p>The rider's face was tied up, as is customary with Mahratta horsemen;
but as he advanced he unwound the scarf about it, and the
stern features and flashing eyes of Tannajee Maloosray appeared to
all. For an instant he was not recognized, and his advance, indeed,
had hardly been noticed at the upper end of the assembly; but some
one who saw him cried "Tannajee!" and the name spread from
mouth to mouth, rising into a roar of welcome among the people, as
the rider struggled on through the crowd which now pressed about
him. Dismounting near the altar, Tannajee gave his horse to a servant;
and as Sivaji and all about him rose to meet him, he ascended
to the royal seat, and was embraced by his prince in a loving greeting.
He had been long absent, and was expected; but his sudden arrival
alone, and at that time of night, boded strange tidings; and while
his arms were yet around his friend, Sivaji anxiously asked what
news he had brought.</p>

<p>"Of sorrow, yet of joy, my prince," replied Maloosray, disengaging
himself. "I heard the news at Jutt, and I made a vow which only
that altar can clear me of, that I would not sit or rest till I had
told it to you and to the people.&mdash;Rise, all of ye!" he shouted to the
assembly in that voice which, clear and sonorous, they had often
heard above the wildest din of battle, "and listen to my words!"</p>

<p>They rose to a man instantly, and with a rustling sound: after
which, there was perfect silence. Every face of those thousands was
turned towards the speaker. Every form, from the highest tiers to
the lowest, bent forward in eager expectation of what should follow.</p>

<p>"Listen," he continued, "O beloved prince and people: we have
fallen upon evil days, for the goddess, our Mother, has been insulted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
and her temple at Tooljapoor desecrated. Yes," he continued, lifting
up his hand to stay the cry which was about to break out,
"Afzool Khan has cast down the image of Toolja Máta, plundered
the temple of its wealth, slain the Brahmuns, and sprinkled the blood
of sacred cows over the shrine; and now the altar there, and the
Mother, are my witness that I have told this grief to ye truly!"</p>

<p>Then burst forth that strange wild cry which the lady mother had
heard above in the fort. Some wept, others shrieked and beat their
mouths, or cast their turbans on the ground. Individual cries, no
matter whether of grief or revenge, were blended into one common
roar from those thousands, which ascended to the sky, and, reverberating
from side to side of the glen, went out through the woods,&mdash;up
the mountain-sides and precipices of the fort,&mdash;softened by distance,&mdash;yet
uniting to produce that unearthly yell or wail which had
arrested her as she left the shrine, and caused the watching priests to
shudder.</p>

<p>Apparently, the people waited to hear from their prince a confirmation
of the news, or intimation of what was to be done; for, at a
motion of his hand, they were once more silent, and listening with
rapt attention.</p>

<p>"I thought the Holy Mother was in sorrow," he said, "for she
has hidden her face from me these many days, and my mother too
sought her, but in vain. And now we know the reason. O friends!
O people! shall it be so? Shall the Mother's temples be desolate?
Not while Sivaji Bhóslay lives, and ye live! Better we died in honour
than lived to be pointed at as cowards, while she is unrevenged!
Listen," he continued, using the same gestures as Tannajee to keep
the people quiet, as he took up the sword lying at his feet. "This,
ye all know, is named after the Mother; see!" and he drew it slowly
from the scabbard, "she hath a bright and lovely face, but it must
be dimmed in Moslem blood: let her drink it freely! So I swear,
and so ye will answer to my cry&mdash;Hur, Hur, Mahadeo!"</p>

<p>As he spoke he flung the scabbard passionately on the ground, and
waved the glittering blade high in the air. Already was men's blood
fiercely stirred by his words, and the Rajah's action rendered them
almost uncontrollable. Not one of all that assembly who wore a
sword was there, that did not draw and wave it as his chieftain had
done; and the light flashing from polished weapons, and the frantic
shouts of the old war-cry, as men swayed to and fro, still more
excited the rude soldiery&mdash;"Hur, Hur, Mahadeo! Dônguras-lavilé
Déva!"</p>

<p>No wonder that the sound had gone up the lofty mountain, and
was the more clearly heard as the Ranee, looking from the tower
above, saw far below the heaving masses in the glen, and caught the
bright glitter of their weapons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span></p>

<p>But there was silence at last. It seemed as if the men expected to
be led there and then against their hereditary foes. That, however,
was not to be yet. During the clamour, Maloosray had told his
chieftain that Afzool Khan's army was on its march, and that means
must be taken to oppose it. So the Rajah once again spoke out in
those clear ringing tones which were heard by all.</p>

<p>"Not now, my people," he cried&mdash;"not now. If we have sworn
to revenge the Mother, she will wait her time, and herself deliver
this arrogant Moslem into our hands. Then, O my friends, shall she
drink infidel blood, and be satisfied to the full. So fear not: if this
news is terrible, it is yet good; so let us rejoice that we have the
more cause to be united in avenging it. And now sit down once
more; and play on, O players! Who shall say that Sivaji Bhóslay
and his people were scared from their Kutha by Afzool Khan?"</p>

<p>"That means, my friends," cried Pundree, one of the clowns, after
turning a preliminary somersault in the air, then resting his hands
on his knees, and wagging his head with mock gravity, "that the
master intends to kill the old Khan himself, and that the Mother will
eat him. Now, as I am going to eat the sheep that have been killed
there, just to save her the trouble, she will be very hungry&mdash;very
hungry indeed; and if her belly is not filled by Afzool Khan, ye are
to kill all his people and satisfy it. Else beware!&mdash;No one likes to
be hungry, good folks; and I, for one, am always ill-tempered and
beat my wife when there is no dinner, or it is badly cooked. I dare
say the Mother is much the same, and if she be so, nothing goes
right in the world; so see that ye strike hard, my sons, and get
plenty of food for her when the master bids ye. Do ye hear? Do
ye understand? As for the cooking of it, ye may leave that to the
devil; and remember that I, Pundrinath, the son of Boodhenâth,
have told ye all this, and will bear witness against ye and Tannajee
Maloosray if ye do it not; and so&mdash;beware, beware!"</p>

<p>And then, amidst the laughter caused by the quaint speech and
actions of the privileged jester, the play proceeded, while Sivaji
heard from his friend Maloosray the tale of the Wuzeer's death, the
Kótwal's execution, and the sack of Tooljapoor.</p>

<p>It was more than ever evident to Sivaji, that to attempt to oppose
Afzool Khan in the field with the men about him, would be madness;
but he might be drawn on, by specious promises of submission, into
wilds where his cavalry and artillery would be useless, and in those
jungles the men then present would be ample against ten thousand
Mahomedan infantry.</p>

<p>Then it was determined to send those agents to Afzool Khan's
camp with whose arrival there we are already acquainted.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_LXXIV" id="CHAPTER_LXXIV">CHAPTER LXXIV.</a></h2>


<p>But the arrival of an Envoy from the Mahomedan General was an
event of no small importance to the Rajah Sivaji. In order to further
the plan he had conceived, and partly executed, in the despatch
of envoys to the Mahomedan camp&mdash;it was his object to disarm all
suspicion; and while assuming an appearance of insignificance and
weakness which should impress upon the mind of a new-comer his
insufficiency to make any resistance, the Rajah was making arrangements
which, as Maloosray and other friends knew, boded action of
no ordinary kind. When the time came, he would act, he said, as
the goddess directed. His mother had been silent for many days,
and almost constantly sat in the temple before the altar; and it was
certain there would be some special revelation. She had spread the
end of her garment<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> before the Mother, and she had never done so,
they said, in vain; but she was silent, and so they waited.</p>

<p>Afzool Khan's Envoy had been received with the utmost distinction.
When within a few miles of the fort he had been met by a
deputation of Brahmuns and inferior military officers, and delayed
only long enough to have the necessary astrological calculations
made as to a propitious moment for entrance into the town. There,
a house was assigned to him: servants of the Rajah appointed to
attend on him: and his escort was supplied with forage and food in
abundance. Nothing was wanting to give assurance of simple but
earnest hospitality.</p>

<p>The day after, an audience of the Rajah was fixed upon. The
Envoy was desired to choose his own time; and the astrologer in his
suite, with that of the Rajah, having ascertained a lucky conjunction
of planets, the Envoy was carried up the mountain-side in a palankeen
to the fort-gate, where sheep were sacrificed before him, cannon
fired from the ramparts, and the fort pipers, drummers, and horn-blowers,
performed a rude and very noisy welcome. Then the men
on guard at the gate, with others of the garrison of the fort, formed
a street, which reached as far as the Rajah's pavilion; and the
palankeen being carried along this, amidst the firing of matchlocks
and shouting of the title of the King of Beejapoor by the royal bard
and herald in his suite, the Envoy was set down before the same rude
pavilion which we have before described, where the Rajah Sivaji
awaited him.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span></p>
<p>To all appearance an insignificant little man, dark, youthful in
appearance, with only one ornament in his turban, dressed in the
plainest clothes, and without even the gold embroidered cushion on
which he had been seated on the day of the Kutha. Punto Gopináth
wondered much when he remembered the exaggerated accounts of
the Prince which were sung in ballads, told by bards and reciters,
and were believed by the people. Was this the saviour who was to
come? Was this the man who was to rescue the Hindu faith from
obloquy, if not from destruction:&mdash;protect Brahmuns, foster learning,
endow and enrich temples? Above all, was this the man who
was to defy the forces of Beejapoor, the fierce Abyssinians, the fiery
Dekhanies&mdash;the noble park of artillery? There were no troops, no
means of offence visible. True, the fort itself was strong, but the
garrison was small, and unworthy of consideration in comparison
with the thousands who were even now nigh at hand.</p>

<p>These thoughts hurried rapidly through the Envoy's mind as he
passed up the street of men, and the Rajah's authorities and higher
order of servants, who stood on each side of this approach to the hall
itself. Puntojee Gopináth was a big man in every sense of the word.
His body was large and corpulent, and he stooped much. His head
was wrapped in a white cashmere shawl, which increased its naturally
disproportionate size. His features were massive but flaccid, and his
cheeks shook, while his head wagged from side to side as he walked.
His eyes were large, but red and watery; and the protruding under-lip,
full, and set in deep lines at the corners, gave him an air of
pompous self-sufficiency.</p>

<p>With all this, the Brahmun was a shrewd, astute person. He was
vain, and usually confident. Now, however, as he saluted the Rajah,
he felt the eyes which scanned him from head to foot had already
taken a measure of him, which might be favourable or otherwise.
Perhaps it was flattering, perhaps mortifying; he could not say
which. They were in any case different eyes to those of his own
rulers and officers, who were Mahomedans. Their eyes took things
for granted, and he was accustomed to placid acquiescence, or perhaps
to occasional fierce bursts of passion, which never affected him.
These eyes, on the contrary, were restless and inquisitive, leaving an
impression that they had seen and understood hidden thoughts, and
would bring them out, lurk where they might.</p>

<p>Perhaps, for the first time in his public life, the Brahmun was
disconcerted; but it was no time to show this; and recovering himself,
he offered the prescribed salutation, and sinking into the seat
pointed out to him, which was beside, but rather in front of the
Rajah, with a loud exclamation of Rámchunder! which was his
habit&mdash;he settled himself on his heels after the most approved courtly
fashion, placed his hands gravely upon his knees, twisted up his
moustaches, and felt his habitual confidence return.</p>

<p>We need not, perhaps, follow the conference. The Envoy, as instructed,
at first took a high tone as to outrages and treason on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
part of the Rajah, and of the clemency and wisdom of the sovereign
he represented. There should have been no attempts at insurrection,
because the cause was hopeless by force, and the royal ear was ever
open to suppliants for justice, if timely submission were made.</p>

<p>The Rajah did not reply personally, but this pitiless scrutiny of
the Envoy continued without interruption, and the address was
answered by Krishnajee Bhaskur, one of his own Brahmun officers,
eloquently and yet respectfully:&mdash;What had been done? No redress
had been given for injury, for extortion, and local oppression. In
despair, some retaliation had been made. It was the mountain
custom, even by village against village; and did not affect higher
relations, which would only become the more firmly consolidated
when the cause of quarrel was past. "But," he added, in conclusion,
"the details are private matters, and will be discussed better in
privacy, and through Afzool Khan alone, does the Rajah wish to
have them arranged. What have we here to oppose him? We have
no concealments, no means of defence against such a force as his?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, no," said Sivaji, smiling. "An army of elephants has
been sent to crush ants' nests, as the proverb hath it; and if the
noble Khan will remain, and take charge of the country now under
me, I will resign it to him cheerfully, and become his servant. Wilt
thou say this to him?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, my prince," returned the Brahmun, putting up his joined
hands, "we who were in Beejapoor well know how much Afzool
Khan helped your father, when he was confined, in the old Sultan's
time; and how much the rigour of his imprisonment was softened
by the Khan's kindness. Ah! he is a humane and generous man,
and has no personal enmity against you, my lord."</p>

<p>"We will at least put it to the proof," returned the Rajah good-humouredly.
"You are witness that you have seen no preparations
for defence or resistance, and the sooner he comes the better. We
cannot hurry him and the force, but we will at least make preparations
for a peaceful entertainment; and if the Khan will accept of our
rude mountain hospitality instead of the Jehâd we hear he has been
preaching against us, it will be a happy thing for all."</p>

<p>"A happy thing indeed!" said Bulwunt Rao, who, in the suite of
the Envoy, had as yet sat silently, and had not been recognized;
"and when public affairs are settled, private justice may be done to
suppliants like me, who, only for state quarrels, dare not have
entered this fort."</p>

<p>"Who art thou, friend?" asked Sivaji; "a suitor to me, and from
Beejapoor?&mdash;a Mahratta among Moslems? Who art thou?"</p>

<p>"I may not mention my name here, my lord," said Bulwunt Rao,
rising, and again saluting the Rajah reverently; "but I can tell it
in private. One whom injustice and evil fate have led where he is,
and who, only for them, would have been serving you."</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span></p>

<p>"How can I serve thee?" asked the Rajah sharply; "I am not
usually hard of access; therefore come to me when thou wilt, and I
will hear thee."</p>

<p>"I will come," returned Bulwunt Rao, looking round to all, "and
put thee, Sivaji Bhóslay, to the proof. Men vaunt the Rajah's
justice," he continued&mdash;"he will find much to do for me;" and he
sat down again.</p>

<p>An awkward pause ensued in the assembly, which no one seemed
inclined to break: and the person who officiated as master of the
ceremonies, having observed a signal from the Rajah, brought in
flowers, with pân leaves, and distributed them in order of precedence
to the Envoy and all his suite. Bulwunt Rao, however, would take
nothing.</p>

<p>"If justice is done me," he said, rising again, "my share of flowers
will come with it, and will be hung about my neck in honour; if not,
they will hang here,"&mdash;and he touched his sword-hilt&mdash;"better."</p>

<p>"This savours of a threat, sir," said Sivaji, with flashing eyes.</p>

<p>"The meanest will turn against oppression," returned Bulwunt;
"and Sivaji Bhóslay has just pleaded this in extenuation of his own
acts. I, too, make the same reply, my prince; and when you know
my history, you will confess I am no traitor to Mahrattas."</p>

<p>"All are dismissed," said the Rajah, rising; "see that these
gentlemen are safely escorted below;" and amidst the confusion
which occurred in many persons rising, and as the Durbar broke up,
he whispered to the Brahmun who had been spokesman, and who
was one of his most confidential servants, "See that the Khan's
Envoy be separately accommodated. I must visit him privately to-night,
and thou must be with me, Krishnajee; I will come to thee
at the first watch."</p>

<p>The Rajah passed into the inner chamber, and found his mother
sitting at the window alone, looking over the road which ascended
to the fort-gate. He prostrated himself before her, as was his
wont, and, sitting down opposite to her in silence, fell apparently
into deep thought. She did not interrupt him; but as the trumpet
sounded, and a salute of cannon was fired from the ramparts, and
the Envoy's procession passed out, and wound down the pass&mdash;she
saw him following the palankeen with his eyes, while his lips moved
gently, as though he spoke to himself. As it disappeared behind a
shoulder of the mountain, he turned to her and smiled.</p>

<p>"Mother," he said, "you saw the Khan's Envoy. I expected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
some stupid, wrong-headed, supercilious Mussulman, but behold he
has sent a Brahmun, and with him a Mahratta, whom we should
know, but no one recognizes him. I think the Mother will give
both to me, yet you said one only."</p>

<p>"My vision was but of one," she replied, "and it will be enough.
Who is the Mahratta?"</p>

<p>"They said his name was Bulwunt Rao, mother, but he did not
mention his surname, and no one knew it," returned the Rajah.</p>

<p>"It must be Bulwunt Rao Bhóslay, Tannajee's cousin," replied
the lady. "I know of no other Mahratta of good family in Beejapoor.
He is a relative of our own."</p>

<p>"Ah!" exclaimed her son, "yes, it must be he; and I have promised
him justice, mother; but what of Tannajee?"</p>

<p>"It cannot be, son," she said; "that is a blood feud, and blood
only will quench it. Tannajee did but revenge a murder, and you
cannot quarrel with him. Let it be; no good will come of it."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless I will try, mother; and if the Brahmun&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Fear not," she returned. "If he be a true Brahmun, the goddess
hath given him to thee. I will go to her. It is my hour for
watching, and I will pray her to guide thee."</p>

<p>Sivaji sat as before, looking out over the rugged mountain-side
and the pass, now glowing in the rich tints of an afternoon sun.
If he could only get Afzool Khan into his power, and hold him sure
as a hostage, he might make his own terms. Would the Brahmun
aid him in this? A word from him and the matter was secure.
If he could only be persuaded to write, a swift messenger might be
sent to the camp, with one of his own officers to guide on the army.
Once the troops entered the defiles they were at his mercy. There
was no escape&mdash;the whole must surrender or be slain; but he well
knew the old Afghan would not agree to dishonour, and to separate
him from his force was therefore his chief anxiety. As yet the
temptation within him had assumed no more definite form; and in
respect to the final result, his mother, strange to say, was altogether
silent; but she had again taken up the position she had assumed
before the shrine for many days past, and his belief in her inspiration
was not to be shaken.</p>

<p>Late that night, muffled in a coarse blanket, and accompanied
only by the Brahmun before mentioned, and a few attendants, the
Rajah descended from the fort by a steep and rugged pathway,
which led from a postern directly to the town, and, leaving the men
at the gate, they passed rapidly on to the house where the Envoy
had been located. It belonged to the Josee or astrologer of the
town, in whose science the Rajah had much faith; and, as was
usual with him on all occasions of great enterprise, the aspects of
the planets had been consulted, and declared to be favourable at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
the hour at which they had purposely timed their arrival. The
Josee met them at the door. "The Pundit is sitting within," he
said, "reading, and there is no one with him. I have prepared the
writing materials, too, as directed, and they will be brought if you
call."</p>

<p>"Wait, then, in the outer court, friends," said the Rajah to his
attendants. "This must be done between us alone. Not even thou,
Krishnajee, must know what passes between us."</p>

<p>Punto Gopináth was sitting in the inner verandah of the second
court of the house, as the Josee had said, reading. He looked up as
the old man entered and said, "There is one here from the Rajah,
who would speak with you."</p>

<p>"Admit him," was the reply; and Sivaji could see as he entered,
that the Brahmun drew towards him a short, heavy dagger-sword,
and placed it so that the hilt lay close to his right hand. "Be seated,
friend," said the Envoy, "and tell thy business. What doth Sivaji
Bhóslay desire of me?"</p>

<p>The Rajah's face was tied up with a handkerchief, which partly
concealed his mouth and changed the tone of his voice, and he had
passed his hand, covered with white wood-ashes, across his nose,
eyes, and forehead, as he entered, which altered the expression of
his eyes very considerably. It was evident that he was not recognized.</p>

<p>"Sivaji Bhóslay desires the prosperity and advancement of
Brahmuns," replied the Rajah, "and to enrich them is his sole care.
He worships them; and would fain have them as powerful as in
the days of the ancients, and in this desire thou canst assist."</p>

<p>"I assist! How, friend? I, a Brahmun, am a receiver, not a
giver,&mdash;and am only a servant to the unclean," he added with a
sigh.</p>

<p>"It need not be so, Pundit. The fame of thy learning hath preceded
thee, and the Maharaja desires thy friendship and welfare. I
am sent to tell thee this."</p>

<p>"What can I do?" said the Envoy restlessly. "What would he
have me do? and who art thou to speak thus to me?"</p>

<p>"No matter who I am&mdash;I am authorized to speak," replied Sivaji.
"Look, here is his ring as my authority. 'Is he a Brahmun,' the
Rajah said, 'and come with Moslem followers to sit in my Durbar?
Alas, alas! that such should be, that the pure and holy should serve
the unclean. This is indeed the age of iron, and of debasement.'"</p>

<p>The Brahmun writhed in his seat. "There are many besides me,"
he said, "who serve the people of Islam."</p>

<p>"Who serve the destroyers of Toolja Máta, the defilers of her
temple, the slayers of Brahmuns, and of sacred kine everywhere!
O, shame&mdash;shame!" cried the Rajah eagerly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span></p>

<p>"I was not at the shrine when the affray took place," said the
Brahmun apologetically. "I could not help it."</p>

<p>"Has then a Brahmun's holiness become so debased that he says
only, I could not help it?" returned the Rajah. "Is it pleasing to
the Mother, think you, that her people should fawn on those whose
hands are red in the blood of her votaries?"</p>

<p>"I would fling my service at the feet of Afzool Khan, and even of
the Sultan himself, could I but serve with Hindus as I desire to
serve," exclaimed the Brahmun.</p>

<p>"The opportunity might be found, friend," answered the Rajah,
"if it were truly desired; but proof of fidelity would be required,&mdash;would
it be given? What is the Maharaja's desire? Dost thou
know it?"</p>

<p>"I guess it," said the Brahmun, "for I am not easily deceived by
appearances, and I understood his looks to-day, if I mistake not.
Could I only speak with him? Canst thou take me to him?"</p>

<p>"I can tell thy message to him," replied the Rajah, "and will
deliver it faithfully. He chose me, else I had not dared to come."</p>

<p>The Envoy appeared to hesitate for a moment. "Impossible," he
said&mdash;"impossible that I could tell another, what Sivaji himself
should alone hear; it could not be."</p>

<p>"Dost thou know me, friend?" returned the Rajah, as he untied
the handkerchief which concealed his face, and with it wiped the
white ashes from his eyes and forehead&mdash;"dost thou know me? It
is thus that I salute a holy Brahmun;" and he rose and made a
lowly reverence, touching the feet of the Envoy respectfully.</p>

<p>The man strove to return it, but was prevented. "It cannot be,"
continued Sivaji; "here thou art a Brahmun, and I a Sudra. Let
it be as I wish. It is for thee to receive the honour, not I."</p>

<p>"What would you have me do, Maharaja?" replied the Envoy,
now trembling much. "I have done evil in helping the unclean,
and would now expiate it if possible."</p>

<p>"I have had many things in my mind, Pundit," replied the Rajah,
"and the Mother sends perplexing thoughts; but one thing is clear
to me&mdash;she must be avenged."</p>

<p>The man echoed the words&mdash;"She must be avenged."</p>

<p>"Yes," continued the Rajah, "day and night, by old and young,
rich and poor, man or woman, there is but one cry going up from
Maharástra&mdash;'Avenge the Mother!' and yet before that force we
are powerless."</p>

<p>"Where are the Mawullees? where are the Hetkurees we have
heard of, and the gallant Tannajee?" cried the Brahmun excitedly.
"What art thou doing, Sivaji Bhóslay? Men say of thee that thy
mother holds thee back, else 'the fire should be on the hills.'"</p>

<p>"Good!" returned Sivaji, smiling; "it is as I thought, and there
is yet a Brahmun who is true. What dost thou advise?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hark!" said Gopináth, "come nearer. If I bring Afzool Khan
and his men within the defiles, will it content thee? If I do this,
what wilt thou do for me?"</p>

<p>"I have prepared for that already,&mdash;a Jahgeer, a high office,
secular or among the priesthood, as thou wilt,&mdash;double thy present
pay, whatever it be,&mdash;an ensign of rank, and&mdash;my friendship. Look,
Pundit," cried the Rajah, springing closer to him, and drawing a
small bright knife from his breast, "it were easy to slay thee,&mdash;for
my knee is on thy weapon,&mdash;and so prevent my proposal being
known: but it is not needed. Fear not," he added, for the drops
of sweat were standing on the Brahmun's brow, under the terror
he felt&mdash;"fear not! only be true, and Sivaji Bhóslay will not fail
thee. When he has a kingdom thou shalt share its honour."</p>

<p>"Give me time to write," said the man, trembling under conviction
of his own treachery and the excess of temptation to which he
was exposed; "I will give the letter to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Impossible, Pundit," replied the Rajah: "the messengers are
ready without, and they will bear what must be written to the
Khan."</p>

<p>"Who will take the letter?"</p>

<p>"The Brahmun who spoke for me this morning; he and some
horsemen are now ready."</p>

<p>"But to the Khan himself there must be no harm done," said the
Pundit. "To him and his son I owe many kindnesses: for the rest,
as thou wilt. Keep the family as hostages."</p>

<p>"As guests yonder," replied the Rajah; "he will be safe, he and
his. Shall I send for writing materials? Krishnajee! Sit there,"
he continued, as his attendant entered; "see that what is written is
plain."</p>

<p>And the Envoy wrote in the Persian character, in which he was a
proficient, and which the other secretary understood:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have seen the Rajah, his fort, and his people, and there is
nothing to apprehend. They are all beneath notice: but in order to
settle everything perfectly, and to inspire terror, my lord should
advance with all the force, according to the plan devised here, which
the bearer, one of the Rajah's secretaries, will explain personally,
and which would be tedious to write. In a strictly private interview,
which will be arranged, the Rajah Sivaji will throw himself
at the feet of the Envoy of the king of kings, and receive the
pardon which he desires. More would be beyond respect."</p>

<p>"It is enough," said Sivaji, when this writing was explained to
him&mdash;"it will have the desired effect. Take this letter, Krishnajee,
and set out for camp at once."</p>

<p>"Stay," added the Envoy, "let him accompany my messenger,&mdash;the
Mahratta officer who spoke so boldly to-day. It were better he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
went, and he will not refuse duty. Enter that room and close the
door, my lord, while I send for him;" and he called to an attendant
to summon Bulwunt Rao.</p>

<p>It was not long ere he came in, flushed somewhat, as it seemed,
with drink. "Who is this?" he said.</p>

<p>"The Maharaja's Secretary, who will accompany thee to camp.
Go at once, if thou art fit, Bulwunt Rao; it is needful that Afzool
Khan receive this as soon as may be."</p>

<p>"I am ready, Maharaj, to ride up Pertâbgurh," he replied; "and
he?"</p>

<p>"I attend you," said the Secretary; "come, we must leave this
when the moon rises;" and they went out together.</p>

<p>"Enough," said the Rajah, emerging from his concealment.
"Generations hereafter will record how Punto Gopináth served his
prince. Fear not&mdash;it will be well with thee and thine hereafter."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_LXXVI" id="CHAPTER_LXXVI">CHAPTER LXXVI.</a></h2>


<p>The letter despatched by the Rajah Sivaji, as we have recorded, was
received in a few days by the Khan, and its tenor was not doubted.
There was nothing in it which could in any degree disturb the
Khan's complacency, or awaken suspicion. If he chafed at the idea
of a bloodless campaign, and his friend the Peer, in the ardour of
his bigotry, sighed at what now promised to be a tame conclusion
to an exciting commencement,&mdash;Fazil, on the other hand, and with
him the commander of the Mahratta contingent in camp, and others
who had more sympathy with the people of the country than their
elders, rejoiced that it was to be so; and that a valuable ally and
confederate was to be secured to the dynasty which they served, by
means which appeared at once just, merciful, and binding upon
both.</p>

<p>The new Envoy who brought the letter, pleased the Khan and the
Peer extremely. In the first place, he spoke the Dekhan court
language fluently, and was a fair Persian scholar. He was known
to the Khan as having served in a subordinate department when he
himself held the administration of Wye, and he gratefully acknowledged&mdash;as
he reminded the Khan of&mdash;former benefits. The first
envoys could not communicate with the Khan except through
interpreters. True, his son was usually present, or occasionally the
holy priest himself, who might be induced to assist; but the Khan
would have better liked to manage these Mahratta envoys himself,
and now there was the desired opportunity. Day after day, as the
army advanced without check, by easy but continuous stages, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
new agent was in close attendance, and very frequently, with the
others, was summoned to private conferences. Fazil, too, had his
share in them, and to every outward appearance no room existed for
suspicion of any kind.</p>

<p>They had now entered the Rajah's own jurisdiction, and were
treated more as honoured guests than as an invading army. Supplies
were provided at every stage, forage was abundant, difficult
places in the roads were found cleared for the artillery, and the
people met them with goodwill and courtesy, which was as pleasant
as unexpected. Any idea of resistance was out of the question.
The usual village guards, or here and there a few horsemen in attendance
on a local functionary, were all that was seen of the Rajah's
forces; and the Khan was amused and gratified with the Envoy's
descriptions of how&mdash;to attract attention to his affairs&mdash;his master
had caused the belief to gain ground that he was possessed of an
army of vast power.</p>

<p>In short, all the obstructions and dangers which had appeared so
great at a distance had passed away; and as the Khan led his troops
more and more deeply into the mountainous district, he could not
but feel that if they had been opposed in those rugged defiles, the
struggle would have been difficult as well as desperate. The enemy
would have had a stronger country to retreat upon, and one more
easily defended, while, in proportion, the advance to him would
have been beset with peril which could hardly be estimated.</p>

<p>Very frequently Fazil asked particulars of the fort of Pertâbgurh
from Bulwunt Rao, who described it clearly enough,&mdash;an ordinary
hill fort, with a garrison strong for local purposes, but, after all,
only such as Mahratta chiefs and gentry kept about them; strong in
their own position, but helpless for offence. Where, then, were the
armies which Sivaji was said to possess? Bulwunt Rao, in reply,
pointed to the village people, all soldiers, he said, from their youth,
and accustomed to arms: but among them there was no symptom
of excitement, nor could Bulwunt Rao, suspecting nothing himself,
discover any cause for alarm: and so they proceeded.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the programme of a meeting had been arranged by
the agents between the Khan and Sivaji. Both parties had mooted
points of etiquette, which could hardly be overcome. The Rajah,
as a prince, could not visit the Khan first, nor could Afzool Khan,
as the representative of royalty, visit the Rajah; but they could both
meet, and the barrier of ceremony once broken, it mattered little
what followed. No troops were to be present. Attended each by a
single armed follower, the place of meeting was fixed on a level
spot at some little distance up the mountain of Pertâbgurh, where
the Rajah, the Envoy said, had already prepared a pavilion, which
would be fitted up for the occasion. If the Khan pleased, he might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
bring a thousand of his best horse&mdash;more, if convenient&mdash;to witness
the ceremony from below; but only one attendant besides the
palankeen-bearers could advance to the conference. Nothing was
to be written, and the agent already at the fort would attend the
Khan on the one hand, while another of the Rajah's, if possible or
needful, would accompany him from above. No objection appeared,
and none was made, to these arrangements.</p>

<p>So the army reached its final stage near the village of Jowly, a
few miles distant from the fort; and the last preparations were
made that night by both parties. The morning would see the Khan
set out early accompanied by fifteen hundred chosen horse&mdash;some
Abyssinian, some Dekhani, others his own retainers,&mdash;all picked
men; while the remainder of the army should rest from its labour
and exertion, which, on account of the rough mountain roads, had
been exceedingly great for the last three days.</p>

<p>At Jowly, too, the camp was more than ordinarily pleasant. A
plain of some extent, and which for the most part was under cultivation,
afforded ample room for all the force. The grassy slopes of
the mountains, by which the plain was surrounded, furnished abundant
supplies of forage; a brawling stream ran under the hills on
one side, and the Rajah's usual supplies of food of all kinds were
abundant at moderate prices in a bazar which, consisting of rough
sheds and small tents, was located near the village on the other.</p>

<p>Let us see how the night was passed by both parties.</p>

<p>The Khan's tents had been pitched on an even sward which
bordered the rivulet, and several fine trees were included in the area
enclosed by the canvas walls. Under the shade of these, Zyna and
Fazil had sat most part of the day. A few carpets and pillows had
been spread there, and the cool fresh mountain air, the brawling
murmur of the brook, and the grand and beautiful scenery by which
they were surrounded, so different to the bare monotonous undulations
of the Dekhan, were in themselves more exciting than it was
possible for them to have imagined from any previous description.
But the loss of Tara's society was pressing heavily upon both. All
they heard daily was, that she was well and among her people, who
were taking care of her. She would remain with them at Wye; and
as the army returned, she should see Lurlee Khánum and Zyna once
more, and take leave of them, for she could not be permitted to
sojourn with Mahomedans. This the Envoy had told the Khan and
Fazil the day before.</p>

<p>It was a dreary prospect for Fazil, and apparently a hopeless one.
Should he ever see that sweet face more? ever hear the music of
the gentle voice, at once so timid and yet so reliant? There was no
hope that the Brahmuns among whom she had fallen would now
give her up voluntarily. It was impossible to think it. Did they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
know what he had asked and she had half-promised?&mdash;would her
life be safe even if they did? Hardly so, indeed; or, if safe, would
be spared at the price of the disfigurement which awaited her,
according to the strict rules of her faith. What they had arranged
among themselves, therefore, could not be openly prosecuted; and,
in defiance of his father's cautions, and the apparently smooth progress
of public affairs, no effort to demand her, or to recover her by
force, could be made as yet.</p>

<p>"Let us settle everything with this Mahratta first, and as we
return by Wye, we will have the girl, or know why," the stout old
Khan used to say; for he had grown to love Tara very dearly, and
missed her presence, though in a different manner, as much as any
of them. "Fear not, Fazil, the Kafirs shall not possess her."</p>

<p>So Zyna and Fazil had sat most part of the day, revolving over
and over again how best Tara might be assisted or rescued, while
blaming themselves a thousand times for that neglect of special precautions
for her safety which had resulted in her abduction.</p>

<p>"If only Moro Trimmul could be found, and brought once more
to account," Fazil said, grinding his teeth, "it would go hard with
him;" but he was not to be heard of. The Envoys in camp declared
he had at once proceeded to Pertâbgurh to clear himself to the
Rajah Sivaji and the lady mother, of whom, in particular, he was an
especial favourite; but he was not now even there: he had been
sent to a distance; where or why it was not known; and it was
impossible to trace him. Bulwunt Rao, Lukshmun, and the lad
Ashruf, had all been employed in turn as spies, but had failed to
discover him&mdash;he was not to be heard of.</p>

<p>It was now late, and the lady Lurlee came and joined them before
the evening prayer. She had been busy after her own fashion, and
as the priest and some others were to dine with the Khan, had prepared
several of her most scientific dishes. She had no doubt as to
the issue of the morrow's interview. In the first place, who could
resist her husband? and were not the planets unusually favourable?
She and the priest had compared notes from behind the screen in
the tent; and though he laughed at the curious jargon she had
collected on the subject, yet, a steadfast believer in astrology himself,
had explained to her how peculiarly fortunate the conjunction was
to be at the hour cast for the meeting, and she had fully believed it.
If Tara had been there, all would have been perfectly happy; but,
as Lurlee said, the planets told her it was only, after all, a matter of
a few days' delay; and, indeed, perhaps, after to-morrow she might
be demanded.</p>

<p>Fazil, however, in spite of these assurances, was not easy; and
after he left the tents for the evening prayer, had taken counsel with
Lukshmun who, in regard to Tara, had taken the place of Bulwunt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
Rao, to whom Fazil dare not intrust his secret. The day she had
disappeared, and Fazil's misery was apparent, the hunchback had
divined the cause; and a few inquiries in his capacity of spy had
confirmed his suspicions.</p>

<p>"I know but of one thing to do, master," he said, as the young
man confided to him his dread of violence to the girl&mdash;"send me
back to Wye, where she is; give me but ever so small a note, and I
will deliver it into her own hand; and if I can bring her away, trust
to me to do so. I can traverse these forests and mountains by night;
I can hide her away or disguise her; and if she be true to thee, she
will come. Give me the boy Ashruf, and a little money, and let us
go, even now. He is without; call him."</p>

<p>"Ashruf," cried the young Khan to the lad, who was standing
near the tent door, and who entered at once; "wilt thou go with
Lukshmun?"</p>

<p>"My lord," replied the lad, "he and I have arranged this already.
They do not know us here, and he has been teaching me a Mahratta
ballad which she knows, and we can sing it in Wye to-morrow. If
he had not spoken I should have told you of our plan. My lord, we
will bring her away silently, and no one shall be the wiser. Yes, I
will go into the fire for my lord, if he will but prove me."</p>

<p>"And Bulwunt Rao?" said Fazil.</p>

<p>"He is in the clouds," replied Lukshmun, "in the hope of getting
back the family estate; wind has got into his head, and he is beside
himself. To my mind, the Rajah would be far better pleased to
have him put out of the way than to favour his pretensions; but
Bulwunt says he has been promised 'justice;' and so," added
Lukshmun, with a hideous grimace, "he will have his own way, and
what is to be is to be; only write the note, master, quick, and let us
go; he won't help us."</p>

<p>"Alas!" replied Fazil, "I can only write Persian; but she knows
my signature, for she used to see me write it. Stay, however," he
continued, unfastening a thin gold ring from his wrist, "she will
remember this better, and understand it: take it with ye, and may
God speed ye. Go at once! Bring her, if possible, or mark where
she is, and we will go, Inshalla! and fetch her."</p>

<p>The priest was chanting the Azân, and Fazil passed out into the
usual place of prayer, which was numerously attended. After its
close, the Peer, his father, and all who were to stay to dinner,
assembled for the repast, which was served immediately. There
was no forward movement of tents that night; and the guests sat till
a late hour discussing the probable events of the morrow, and the
possibility of an early countermarch, at least as far as Wye, where
the open country was preferable to their present confined situation
among the mountains.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_LXXVII" id="CHAPTER_LXXVII">CHAPTER LXXVII.</a></h2>


<p>Was there equal confidence in the fort? We must now go there,
and listen to the midnight consultation, which may be prolonged
till daylight; and yet men on the eve of some desperate enterprise
for which they have prepared themselves, need more rest, and often
sleep more calmly, than at any other period of their existence.</p>

<p>It was the same chamber that we have formerly seen; but the
window of the oriel is shut, for the night wind at that height is cold
and bleak, and thick, quilted curtains, which have been let fall
before it and the doorway, exclude all air. Sivaji, Maloosray, and
Palkur are sitting together, but are silent, for the Rajah's mind is
troubled.</p>

<p>"If I only knew what she would have me do," he said at length,
looking up. "Hast thou prepared all, Tannajee?"</p>

<p>"Master," he replied, "everything is ready. By midnight, or a
little later, Moro Trimmul and the rest of the veterans will be in
the woods near Jowly, around the camp. Every position has been
marked out, and will be silently taken up. Nothing can escape out
of that plain, and they will await the signal of the five guns from
hence. The Brahmun swears," he continued, after a pause, "that
he will take the pretty sister of the young Khan, in revenge for his
seduction of the Tooljapoor Moorlee."</p>

<p>"He dare not," said Sivaji quickly. "I have heard that girl was an
honoured guest in Afzool Khan's family; the Brahmuns say she was.
No, he dare not touch her; and I have warned him not to do so."</p>

<p>Maloosray shrugged his shoulders. "Perhaps," he said; "God
knows! but Moro says otherwise. Let it pass; it is not our
business; but he will be none the less active to get the whole family
into his power."</p>

<p>"And you, Nettajee?" said the Rajah, turning to him.</p>

<p>"There are five thousand of my best Mawullees sleeping in the
thickets east of the fort-gate. They will close in behind the
Beejapoor people as they pass, and when we hear the horn, I think,
master, few will escape&mdash;yes," he continued, fixing his large black
eyes on the Rajah, and slightly twisting his moustaches, "few will
escape."</p>

<p>"O, the blind confidence of these Beejapoor swine!" cried the
Rajah, laughing, as he lifted up his hands. "They have neither eyes
nor ears, else they had guessed we are not as we seem. But the goddess
Mother has blinded and deafened them, and it is as my mother
said it would be."</p>

<p>"Where is she?" asked Maloosray; "she should bless us ere we
go forth."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span></p>

<p>"She is in the temple, and uneasy. As the time comes on, they
think she will have a visitation," he replied. "Ah! here is some
one to tell us. What news, Bheemee?"</p>

<p>"The lady mother is uneasy, Maharaj, and rocking herself to and
fro. It is coming on her, and ye should be near to listen."</p>

<p>"Come, friends, let us go," said the Rajah; "on this revelation
depends my course to-morrow."</p>

<p>It was but a few steps, and the place is already familiar to us. The
low porch and dark vestibule, the small shrine within, from whence
a strong light is shining into the gloom, resting sharply upon the
figure of the Ranee as she sat before it, not quietly now, as when we
saw her once before, but with her shoulders and bosom heaving rapidly,
her eyes shut, or if opened for a moment flashing with excitement,
her lips trembling and already speckled with foam; and that peculiar
sharp, rocking motion of her body, which always preceded the
final attack.</p>

<p>The men stood by reverently. No one dared to speak. The attendant
Brahmun offered flowers from time to time, and kept up a low
chant or incantation, while occasionally he threw grains of coloured
rice upon the altar.</p>

<p>Suddenly the lady stretched forth her arms and shrieked wildly.
Maloosray would have rushed forward, but Sivaji held him back.
"Wait," he said in a low tone, "no one dares to interrupt her;
wouldst thou go to death between her and the Mother? She will
come&mdash;listen."</p>

<p>There was first a low muttering in which nothing could be distinguished;
but words at last followed, to them terrible and awful,
as, believing in the dread presence of the goddess, the lady poured
them forth with gasps.</p>

<p>"O, I thirst! My children were slain&mdash;and no one has avenged
them. Blood! blood! I thirst. I will drink it! The blood of the
cruel&mdash;of the cow-slayers! All, all&mdash;the old and the young; the old
woman and the maiden; the nurse and the child at her breast; all&mdash;all&mdash;all!"
she continued, her voice rising to a scream. "They who
love me, kill for me; for I thirst,&mdash;for I thirst now, as I did for the
blood of the demons," and the voice again sank to a low whisper
which was not audible.</p>

<p>These words had come from her by spasms, as it were; painfully,
and with much apparent suffering. She shrieked repeatedly as she
uttered them, and clutched at the air with a strange convulsive
movement of both hands: sometimes as if apparently drawing to her,
or again fiercely repelling an object before her. At last she stretched
forth her hands and her body, as if following what she saw, and
looking vacantly into the space before her with a terrified expression
of countenance, the hands fell listlessly on her lap, and her features<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
relaxed into a weary expression, as of one who had endured acute
pain. Then she sighed deeply, opened her eyes, looked around, and
spoke. "Bheemee, I thirst," she said gently,&mdash;"bring me water."</p>

<p>Sivaji alone had remained with his mother and the Brahmun of
the temple, who, as she spoke them, recorded the disconnected
sentences. The Rajah's companions, fearless before an enemy, were
cowards before the dread presence in which they believed.</p>

<p>"Ah, thou art here, son," she said, turning to him. "Did I speak?
Surely the Mother was with me," and she sighed deeply, again
drawing her hand wearily across her eyes.</p>

<p>"Come and rest, mother," he replied, raising her up and supporting
her tenderly. "Come, thou art weary."</p>

<p>"Weary indeed, my son," she said,&mdash;"there is no rest for me till
all is finished. Come, and I will tell thee everything;" and he
followed her into her own apartments, where she lay down. The
attendant brought water, and she drank a deep draught.</p>

<p>"What did I say, son?" she continued. "But no matter. It is
all blood before me&mdash;carnage and victory! Blood!" she cried excitedly,
grasping his arm and looking intently into his face. "Art
thou ready? ready for victory!&mdash;ready to cry 'Jey Kalee! Jey
Toolja Máta!'"</p>

<p>"Ready, mother&mdash;yes. There is no failing anywhere. The men
are at their posts, and the signals have been decided upon. No one
will escape us now."</p>

<p>"No one will escape," she echoed,&mdash;"no one must escape&mdash;no&mdash;not
one&mdash;not even he."</p>

<p>"Ah, mother," cried Sivaji, "not so; surely with pledged honour,
soldier to a soldier, and a solemn invitation, it could not be."</p>

<p>"It must be, son," she said gloomily, "else the sacrifice is incomplete
and of no avail. Wilt thou risk that for thine own sake&mdash;for
my sake&mdash;for the sake of our faith? I see it all," cried the lady
excitedly, "passing before me&mdash;a triumph of glory over those
defilers of the temples of the gods; thy rapid rise to power; the
legions of the hateful Mahomedans trampled in the dust by greater
legions of thine own. 'Jey Sivaji Rajah!' shall be cried from
Dehli to Raméshwur.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Wilt thou now turn back? wilt thou be
forsworn to her&mdash;to the Mother who is our life? Wilt thou be as
vacillating as thy father? Beware! thou art more committed to
her than he&mdash;and does she spare backsliders?"</p>

<p>"He is but one to be spared, mother, and that because of my
promise," he pleaded.</p>
<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span></p>
<p>"I tell thee it cannot be, my son. She will have him&mdash;the slayer
of the priests&mdash;the murderer of hundreds of the people about her
shrine. And that priest of his who, as all say, led the slaughter,
cast down her image, and trampled on it! O son, canst thou
hesitate? art thou&mdash;so firm and true always&mdash;now grown weak?
have I borne one in travail who is degenerate? Choose then, now&mdash;victory
and future blessing, or the result which thou knowest,
and we all know, if we fail her&mdash;the death which must ensue. Both
are before thee; choose, boy; I can say no more!" and she turned
away her face to the wall.</p>

<p>But she had conquered, for there was no defying her will,&mdash;always
the mainspring of the Rajah's actions&mdash;and, backed by those
seemingly divine revelations in which he devoutly believed, he did
not resist her.</p>

<p>"Mother," he said, rising and prostrating himself before her, "I
know&mdash;I feel that the goddess is speaking from thy mouth still.
I hear and obey. Bless me, O my mother, and my hand will be
strong; put thy hands on my head, and the Mother will guide the
blow surely."</p>

<p>"I do bless thee, Sivaji Bhóslay," she returned, placing her hands
on his head, "in the name of her who directs us, and with her
power I endue thee. Go and fear not, but do her bidding&mdash;thou
shalt not fail."</p>

<p>He rose. "I will but speak with Maloosray and dismiss them,"
he said, "and return. Make up a bed for me here, for I would
sleep near thee, mother, to-night."</p>

<p>"Get thee to thy post, Nettajee," he said to Palkur, as he met
them without; "there is no fear now; victory is with us&mdash;she hath
said it. Let the men sleep and be ready."</p>

<p>"And what will you do with him&mdash;the Khan?" asked Maloosray.</p>

<p>"You will see to-morrow," said Sivaji excitedly. "You will be
with me, and will share the danger. This was reserved for you,
O well-tried friend!"</p>

<p>"Enough," said Maloosray to Palkur; "let us go, for the master
needs rest;" and, saluting him, they departed.</p>

<p>Sivaji returned to his mother. A low bed had been prepared in
the room, and she was sitting by it. He took off his upper garment
and turban, and, having performed his ablutions, lay down, and she
patted him gently, as she used to do when he was a child. He
would have spoken, but she would not listen, and he urged her to
sleep herself, but she would not leave him; and when the dim light
of day broke gently into the chamber, he woke, and found she had
not stirred from his side. "Arise," she said, "it is time. Food is
prepared for thee. Eat, and go forth to victory!"</p>

<p>He obeyed her; bathed, worshipped earnestly in the temple, and
ate heartily. Then he returned to her, and, in the simple words of
the old Mahratta Chronicle, "laid his head at his mother's feet, and
besought a blessing. He then arose, put on a steel cap, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>
chain armour, which was concealed under a thickly-quilted cotton
gown; and, taking a crooked dagger which he hid under his sleeve,
and the 'tiger's claws'<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> in his right hand, he girded his loins, and
went out."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_LXXVIII" id="CHAPTER_LXXVIII">CHAPTER LXXVIII.</a></h2>


<p>The morning broke, calm and beautiful. Long before the highest
peaks of the mountains blushed under the rosy light which preceded
the sunrise, the Khan and Fazil, with Zyna, had risen and performed
their morning prayer. The deep booming sound of the kettle-drums
woke the echoes around, and reverberated from side to side of the
valley, retiring to recesses among the glens, and murmuring softly
as it died away among the distant peaks and precipices. As yet, the
valley was partially filled with mists, which clung to its wooded sides;
but as the sun rose, a slight wind sprang up with it, which, breaking
through these mists, drove them up the mountain, and displayed the
scenery in all its fresh morning beauty, as though a curtain had been
suddenly drawn from before it.</p>

<p>Behind them were the stupendous mountains of the Maha-bul-eshwur
range; before, at a short distance, and divided from them by a chain
of smaller hills, rose up the precipices of Pertâbgurh, glittering in the
morning light, and crowned by the walls and bastions of the fortress.</p>

<p>Long before daylight the lady Lurlee had risen, and, careful for
her husband, had, in conjunction with Kurreema, cooked his
favourite dish of kichéri and kabobs. "It was a light breakfast,"
she said, "and would agree with them better than a heavier repast,
and dinner would be ready when they returned." So Afzool Khan,
his son, and the priest, ate their early meal, not only in joyful anticipation
of a speedy return, but of accomplishing what would result
in honour to all concerned.</p>

<p>They remembered afterwards, that as an attendant brought before
the Khan the usual mail shirt he wore, and the mail-cap, with its
bright steel chains, over which his turban was usually tied when fully
accoutred, he laughingly declined both. "They will be very hot and
uncomfortable," he said, "and we are not going to fight. No, give
me a muslin dress," which he put on. A few words about ordinary
household matters to Lurlee, a few cheering sentences to Zyna, as
he passed from the inner and private enclosure of the tent, and he
went out among the men.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span></p>
<p>Fazil followed, fully armed and accoutred for riding. There had
been a good-humoured strife between Fazil and the priest the night
before, as to who should be the one armed follower to accompany his
father, and he had chosen the priest. "Fazil was too young yet," he
said, "to enter into grave political discussions with wily Mahrattas,
and would be better with the escort." So the soldier-priest, like the
Khan, discarding the steel cap, gauntlets, and quilted armour in
which he usually accoutred himself&mdash;appeared, like Afzool Khan, in
the plain muslin dress of his order; and having tied up his waist
with a shawl, and thrown another over his shoulders, stuck a light
court sword into his waist-band, which he pressed down on his hips
with a jaunty air, and called merrily to Fazil, to see how peacefully
he was attired.</p>

<p>The escort awaited them in the camp, and the spirited horses of
fifteen hundred gallant cavaliers were neighing and tossing their heads
as Afzool Khan, Fazil, and the priest rode up. "Forward!" cried
the Khan cheerily; and as the kettle-drums beat a march, the several
officers saluted their commander, and, wheeling up their men, led
them by the road pointed out by the Brahmuns and guides in the
direction of Pertâbgurh.</p>

<p>At that time, single men, who looked like shepherds tending sheep,
and who were standing on crests of the hills, or crouching so as not
to be seen, passed a signal that the Khan and his party had set out.
It was still early, and the time when, of all others perhaps, armies
such as the Khan's, were most defenceless. Many, roused for a
while by the assembly and departure of the escort, had gone to sleep
again; others, sitting over embers of fires, were smoking, preparing
to cook their morning repast, or were attending to their horses, or in
the bazar purchasing the materials for their day's meal. The camp
was watched from the woods around by thousands of armed men,
who, silently and utterly unobserved, crept over the crests of the
hills, and lay down in the thick brushwood which fringed the plain.</p>

<p>As the Khan's retinue neared the fort, parties of armed men, apparently
stationed by the roadside to salute him as he passed, closed
up in rear of the escort; and others, moving parallel to them in the
thickets, joined with them unseen. Quickly, too, men with axes
felled large trees, which were thrown down so as to cross the road,
and interlaced their branches so as to be utterly impassable for horsemen;
and all these preparations went on in both places silently,
methodically, and with a grim surety of success, imparting a confidence
which all who remembered it afterwards attributed to the
direction of the goddess whom they worshipped. As it was said
then, as it is still said, and sung in many a ballad, "not a man's hand
failed, not a foot stumbled."</p>

<p>At the gate of the fort the Khan dismounted from his horse, and
entered his palankeen. Before he did so, however, he embraced his
son, and bid him be careful of the men, and that no one entered the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
town or gave offence. He could see, looking up, the thatched pavilion
on the little level shoulder of the mountain, and pointed to it cheerfully.
"It is not far to go, Huzrut," he said to the Peer, "I may as
well walk with these good friends," and he pointed to the Brahmuns
who attended him. But Fazil would not allow it, nor the Peer either.
"You must go in state," they said, "as the representative of the King
ought to do," and he then took his seat in the litter.</p>

<p>"Khóda Hafiz&mdash;may God protect you, father!" said Fazil, as he
bent his head into the palankeen, when the bearers took it up; "come
back happily, and do not delay!"</p>

<p>"Inshalla!" said the Khan smilingly, "fear not, I will not delay,
and thou canst watch me up yonder." So he went on, the priest's
hand leaning upon the edge of the litter as he walked by its side.</p>

<p>On through the town, from the terraced houses of which, crowds
of women looked down on the little procession, and men, mostly unarmed,
or unremarkable in any case, saluted them, or regarded them
with clownish curiosity. No one could see that the court of every
house behind, was filled with armed men thirsting for blood, and
awaiting the signal to attack.</p>

<p>The Khan's agent, Puntojee Gopináth, being a fat man, had left
word at the gate which defended the entrance of the road to the fort,
that he had preceded the Khan, and would await him at the pavilion.
He had seen no one since the night before, and he knew only that the
Khan would come to meet the Rajah. That was all he had stipulated
for, and his part was performed. He believed that Sivaji would seize
Afzool Khan, and hold him a hostage for the fulfilment of all his
demands; and the line of argument in his own mind was, that if the
Khan resisted, and was hurt in the fray which might ensue, it was
no concern of his. But he did not know the Rajah's intention, nor
did the Rajah's two Brahmuns who had ascended with him; and
they all three now sat down together upon the knoll, waiting the
coming of Afzool Khan from below, and the Rajah from above.</p>

<p>As the agreement had specified, except one each, there were to be
no armed men: no other people were present but one, who seemed
to be a labourer, who was tying up a rough mat to the side of the
pavilion to keep out the wind and sun. Gopináth looked from time
to time up the mountain-road, and again down to the town, speculating
upon the cause of delay in the Rajah's coming; and the others
told him he would not leave the fort till the Khan had arrived below,
and showed him a figure standing upon the edge of the large bastion
which overhung the precipice above, relieved sharply against the
clear sky, which was fronting towards the quarter by which the
Khan's retinue should come, and apparently giving signals to others
behind him.</p>

<p>"Your master is coming," said the Secretary, "they see him from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>
above;" and, almost as he spoke, the bright glinting of steel caps
and lance-heads, with a confused mass of horsemen, appeared on the
road to the fort, among the trees, and they sat and watched them
come on. Then the force halted in the open space before the outer
gate, where the Khan's little procession formed, and entered the town.
After that, the houses and the trees of the mountain-side concealed
them. How beautiful was the scene!</p>

<p>The wind had died away, and the sun shone with a blaze of heat
unknown elsewhere, striking down among those moist narrow valleys
with a power which would have been painful, but for the cool refreshing
air by which it was tempered. The distant mountains glowed
under the effect of the trembling exhalations, which, rising now
unseen, tempered the colours of the distance to that tender blue and
grey which melts into the tint of the sky. The rugged precipices
above were softened in effect; and the heavy masses of foliage, festoons
of creepers, and the dense woods, rich in colour, combined to
enhance the wonderful beauty of the spot. There was perfect silence,
except the occasional monotonous drumming notes of woodpeckers
in the glens, and the shrill chirrup of tree-crickets which occasionally
broke out and was again silent.</p>

<p>In a few minutes, the shouts of the Khan's palankeen-bearers were
heard below, and the litter suddenly emerged from a turn in the road,
being pushed on by the combined efforts of the men. The Brahmun's
heart bounded when he saw the figure of the priest beside the litter,
holding to it, and pressing up the ascent vigorously. "Will he
escape?" he said mentally; "the Mother forbid it,&mdash;let her take
him!" A few more steps, and the palankeen was at the knoll; it
was set down, and the Khan's shoes being placed for him by a bearer,
he put his feet into them and got out, speaking to the priest, who
was panting with his exertion.</p>

<p>"Is he not here, Puntojee?" cried the Khan to the Brahmun,
who saluted him respectfully.</p>

<p>"No, my lord, not yet. Ah! look," he continued, as he turned
towards the pass, "there are two men on the path, and that one, the
smallest, is he."</p>

<p>The men coming down appeared to hesitate, and waved their hands,
as if warning off some one.</p>

<p>"It is the bearers," said one of Sivaji's Secretaries. "The Rajah
is timid, and fears the crowd he sees."</p>

<p>The Khan laughed. "Good," he said to the men. "Go away;
sit down yonder in the shade. You will be called when I want you;"
and as they got up and retired, the two men advanced slowly and
cautiously down the pathway.</p>

<p>Afzool Khan went forward a few paces as Sivaji and Maloosray
came up. "You are welcome, Rajah Sahib. Embrace me," he said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
to Sivaji. "Let there be no doubt between us;" and he stretched
forth his arms in the usual manner.</p>

<p>Sivaji stooped to the embrace; and as the Khan's arms were laid upon
his shoulders, and he was thus unprotected, struck the sharp deadly
tiger's-claw dagger deeply into his bowels, seconding the blow with
one from the other dagger which he had concealed in his left hand.</p>

<p>Afzool Khan reeled and staggered under the deadly wounds.
"Dog of a Kafir!" he cried, pressing one hand to the wound, while
he drew the sword he wore with the other, and endeavoured to
attack the Rajah. Alas! what use now were those feeble blows
against concealed armour? Faint and sick, the Khan reeled hither
and thither, striking vainly against the Rajah, who, with the terrible
sword now in his hand, and crying the national shout of "Hur, Hur,
Mahadeo!" rained blow upon blow on his defenceless enemy. It
was an unequal strife, soon finished. Falling heavily, Afzool Khan
died almost as he reached the earth.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Maloosray had attacked the priest with all his force
and skill, but the Peer was a good swordsman, and for a short time
held his ground. Neither spoke, except in muttered curses, as blows
were struck; but Tannajee Maloosray had no equal in his weapon,
and as he cried to the Rajah, who was advancing to his aid, to keep
back&mdash;the priest, distracted by the assault of another enemy, received
his death-blow, and sank to the ground.</p>

<p>"Jey Kalee!" shouted both. "Now, blow loud and shrill, Gunnoo,
for thy life," continued the Rajah, "and thou shalt have a collar of
gold."</p>

<p>The man who had appeared to be a labourer, seized his horn, which
had been concealed in the grass, and blew a long note, with a shrill
quivering flourish at the close, which resounded through the air, and
echoed among the mountains; and thrice repeated the signal.</p>

<p>Then a great puff of smoke, followed by a report which thundered
through the valley, burst from the bastion above. Those who were
looking from the fort, and the Rajah himself, who ran to the edge of
the knoll, saw the wreaths of fire which burst from the thickets about
the plain where the Mahomedan cavalry stood, and a sharp irregular
crash of matchlock shots came up from below, and continued.
Hundreds died at every volley, and there were writhing, struggling
masses of horses and men on the plain&mdash;loose horses careering about;
and some men still mounted, strove to pierce the barriers which had
been made on every side, crowded on each other, and, falling fast,
became inextricable. Soon, too, the Mawullees, under Nettajee
Palkur, emerged sword in hand from their ambush, and attacked
those who survived. Some escaped; but of the fifteen hundred men
who had ridden there in their pride that morning, few lived to tell
the tale.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Moro Trimmul had taken up his position over night on a hill
overlooking the main camp of Afzool Khan's army. A few boughs
placed together formed a cover and screen on a high knoll, which
commanded a view of the camp beneath, and of the summit of the
fort whence his signal was to come. He sat there watching, and
observed the force below, careless, without a guard, without weapons&mdash;the
men sitting idly, wandering about, or cooking, as it might be.
Every moment seemed interminable; and the eyes of those who
looked with him were strained towards the fort.</p>

<p>"One," he cried at last, as the first puff of bright smoke burst from
the bastion&mdash;"two&mdash;three&mdash;four&mdash;five! Enough. It is complete,
my friends. Now, cry 'Hur, Hur, Mahadeo!' and upon them.
Spare no one! Come, friends, let us sack the Khan's tents first,
where I have some work of my own to do."</p>

<p>"Beware," said an elderly officer, who stood near him&mdash;"beware,
Moro Pundit, of the master, if thou disobey him in this. He will suffer
no insult to the women."</p>

<p>"Tooh!" cried Moro Trimmul, spitting contemptuously, "I am a
Brahmun, and he dare not interfere with me. Come!"</p>

<p>Ten thousand throats were crying the battle-cry of the Hetkurees,
as they burst from the thickets upon the bewildered army. Why
follow them? In a few hours there was a smell of blood ascending
to the sky, and vultures&mdash;scenting it from their resting-places on
the precipices of the mountains, and from their soaring stations in the
clouds&mdash;were fast descending upon the plain in hideous flocks.</p>

<p>Shortly after the Khan had left&mdash;he could scarcely have reached
the fort&mdash;two figures, a man and a boy, ran rapidly across the camp
at their utmost speed towards the Khan's tents&mdash;they were the
hunchback and Ashruf. When Fazil had dismissed them, the night
before, they had taken the road to Wye; and immediately beyond
the confines of the camp, where the road ascended a rocky pass, had
been seized by the Mahratta pickets posted there. In vain they urged
they were but Dekhan ballad-singers; they were not released. "Ye
shall sing for us to-morrow," they said, "when we have made the
sacrifice, the ballads of the goddess at Tooljapoor;" and, bound
together, they lay by the tree where the party of men was stationed.
There they heard all, but were helpless.</p>

<p>"Ah, masters," said Lukshmun, as daylight broke, "unbind us;
we are stiff with the cold; we will not run away; and I will sing
you the morning hymn of the goddess, as the Brahmuns sing it at
Tooljapoor. See, my arms are swelled, and the boy's too."</p>

<p>"Loose him, brother," said one of the men, "we shall soon now
have the signal. Wait you here," he added, as Lukshmun finished
the chant, "and we will fill your pouches with Beejapoor rupees
when we come back."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span></p>

<p>"Alas!" said the hunchback, with a rueful face, "this little brother
came from Wye last night, to say my elder brother, Rama, was dead.
Good sirs, let me go and bury him," and he began to sob bitterly.</p>

<p>"Let them go, Nowla," said another of the men; "they will be
only in our way; we can't stop to guard them."</p>

<p>"My blessings on ye, gentlemen! Only let us go now, and we will
come to you and sing congratulations when you have won the
victory," said Lukshmun humbly.</p>

<p>"Go," said the men, "but do not return to camp, else we will slay
you if we see you there."</p>

<p>"They will die, or worse," said the hunchback, whispering to
Ashruf, "for Moro Trimmul is the leader here. Come, let us save
the Khan's wife and the lady Zyna," and they turned into the
jungle in the direction of the camp.</p>

<p>The boy was bold and quick-witted. As they ran on, "I can get
into the zenana," he said, "under the tent wall, and perhaps we can
make them change clothes, and fly&mdash;but if they stay?"</p>

<p>"I will get the ponies ready," replied the other, and they ran the
faster over the plain, unperceived.</p>

<p>They reached the tents, and the boy entered as he said. Who
would believe them? Zyna heard the tale with sickening dread,
and Lurlee, assured by the others, at first disbelieved him, and
threatened him with stripes. The women-servants crowded around,
and some began to shriek, and were with difficulty pacified; others
mocked him and turned away. Still the boy urged: and the hunchback,
desperate, and dreading the delay, now found his way into the
enclosure, and prostrated himself before them.</p>

<p>"I know the country," he said: "fly! take what jewels you can
carry, and come. God be with them, lady!" he continued, as Zyna
and Lurlee cried aloud for their husband and brother&mdash;"God be
with them! they are mounted and will escape, and we may yet
meet; but stay not here, else ye will die, or be dishonoured, and the
Khan will kill me."</p>

<p>Then another voice was heard without, shouting. It was Shêre
Khan, who had been left in charge of the private camp. "Go!" he
cried, "I see men moving in the woods, and there is confusion and
treachery." And others said the same. Then, too, they heard the
five guns of the fort, and there broke from the mountains around a
hoarse roar of voices, "Hur, Hur, Mahadeo!"</p>

<p>This decided them. A hurried change of clothes, some coarse
garments thrown over them, and the ponies being led within the
enclosure, the ladies were lifted on them and carried out. O, to see
the stupid misery of those women! Hitherto secluded, they could
understand nothing; they had no power to resist; and why they
should be taken out among men, when the shouts and screams of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
camp were growing wilder every moment, they could not understand.
So they wrung their hands in speechless terror.</p>

<p>"Come with the ladies, Shêre Khan," cried Lukshmun; "come,
save thyself, old man!"</p>

<p>"No," he replied sadly; "my time is come, and the sherbet of
death will be sweet. Go thou, and all of ye who can," he added to
those who had gathered with the women. "Quick! quick! else it
will be too late."</p>

<p>The shouts of "Hur, Hur, Mahadeo!" were already mingling on
the confines of the camp with the battle-cries of the Moslems, who
had rallied in small parties, and the flood of attack was there stayed
for a little: this saved the fugitives. Close by the enclosure of tent
walls ran the rivulet, and its banks were high and covered with
brushwood on the sides, which concealed the party. Lukshmun,
with a true freebooter's instinct, led Zyna's pony down the bank,
accompanied by some of the terrified women-servants, and Lurlee
followed. So they proceeded at a rapid pace down the stream,
meeting no one, and concealed from view.</p>

<p>They heard the hideous din of shouts, screams, and shots increase
behind them, but it gradually softened with distance, and in a little
time Lukshmun turned up the sandy bed of a tributary brook, on
the sides of which the jungle was thicker, while the bed was narrower
and more tortuous; and, bidding every one tread only in the shallow
stream which flowed in the midst, in order to afford no traces of
footsteps, he hurried on, still leading Zyna's pony by the bridle.
"Fear not, lady," he said confidently,&mdash;"the worst is past, and God
will be merciful; fear not."</p>

<p>In the camp there was but a short resistance. On the one hand,
the desperate valour of the mountain soldiery, the certainty of plunder,
revenge for Tooljapoor, and the example of Moro Trimmul and other
leaders; and on the other, the helpless, disorganized, bewildered
mass before them, rendered the assault irresistible. The first attacking
bodies were succeeded by mass upon mass of fresh assailants
from all quarters, and these successive tides of men surged resistlessly
across the camp, overwhelming all.</p>

<p>When Moro Trimmul and his party reached the Khan's tents, they
found no one. The tracks of the ponies, where they had descended
the bank, were, however, visible, and were taken up by his followers,
who dashed forward like bloodhounds on a scent. "Away after
them, Kakrey!" cried the Brahmun to a subordinate officer. "Thou
art a better tracker than I. Bring them to me,&mdash;then," he added to
himself, "Fazil Khan, we will see who wins the game,&mdash;you or I."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_LXXIX" id="CHAPTER_LXXIX">CHAPTER LXXIX.</a></h2>


<p>The ambassador's family, with whom Tara had received protection,
had arrived at Pertâbgurh the day before the events related in the
last chapter. At Wye some traces of her mother's family, the
Durpeys, had been found, but they were now residing at or near
Poona: it would require several days to communicate with them;
and a much longer period for them, or any one of them, to come
for Tara and take her away. Meanwhile, therefore, there was no
resource but to stay where she was, and to endure, what was daily
becoming more and more insupportable.</p>

<p>Personally, Govind Rao, the Envoy, was kind to her, and continually
renewed his offers of assistance and protection; but from
his sister, the widow Pudma Bye, Tara had to endure insult and ill-usage,
from which the Envoy's wife was unable to save her. Few,
indeed, in the house, chose to risk the bitterness of Pudma's tongue,
or the virulence of her spite. Her brother even feared her, and
avoided her as much as possible.</p>

<p>So she employed herself in ascetic penances and religious exercises,
fasted long and often, and mortified herself in various ingenious ways,
with a view to establishing a character for sanctity which should
make her famous. As might be supposed, she, the general distributor
of the family alms, had many friends among the priestly
Brahmuns, who attended the house and partook of her brother's
charity; and it was an object with many, by flattering her vanity,
to make those alms as large as possible, and to induce her to undertake
ceremonies which could not be performed without priestly aid,
and, necessarily, money.</p>

<p>The chief of these priests was one Wittul Shastree, an elderly man
of grave aspect, but with a hard expression of countenance, which
might proceed from austerity or avarice, or both combined. He was
the agent or commissary of the prince superior of the Brahmuns of
the province, and held authority sufficient for the disposal of cases
of heretical error, misconduct as to caste affairs, and other matters
of religious discipline. On grave occasions of ceremony he directed
these proceedings, and, in virtue of his office, was in proportion
feared by all who might by any possibility come under his influence
or power.</p>

<p>Tara's presence in the family could not be kept a secret. The fact
of a widow existing there who wore silken garments and jewels, and
who had not her head shaved, was an infringement of caste discipline
which required prompt investigation; and as the Envoy
arrived at the fort, the Shastree betook himself to Pudma Bye, as
well to receive the donations which were his due since she had
been absent, as to make inquiry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span></p>

<p>The Envoy himself was absent at the Rajah's Kuchéri. Amba
Bye was busy arranging her house after her long absence, and Tara
was assisting her with an alacrity and intelligence which at once
surprised and gratified her. On her own part, the worthy good-natured
dame was not slow in evincing warm affection: which had
arisen out of the helpless condition of Tara on the one hand, and the
loving confidence which she had displayed on the first evening of
their companionship.</p>

<p>Ah! it was a cruel struggle for the poor girl. Perhaps we, who
belong to another creed and faith, can hardly estimate it. And yet
the springs and motives of human action have parallels so close
everywhere, that we can at least follow the events which had to be
endured, alike without aid, and without sympathy.</p>

<p>Poor Tara! could she deny herself the secret contemplation of the
noble youth who, she knew, was her lover? Could she forget the sweet
companionship of Zyna, the rough but loving caresses of the Khan's
wife, and the hearty greeting of the Khan himself? Alas, no! it
was impossible, and yet all these were in direct antagonism with
her own creed, with the people of her own faith. What had she
been taught to believe, but that Brahmuns were the gods of the earth&mdash;divine
emanations, incapable of sin, and only resting here for a
while in expiation of the errors of former births, till they were
absorbed again into divinity, as a drop of rain-water in the sea, or
as the sparks falling back into the fire!</p>

<p>She herself was a Brahmun of the highest rank and caste: the
very idea of a Mussulman should have been abhorrent and repellant
to her. Was it so? Alas, no! She, an orphan as she believed herself,
had felt her sorrow soothed, and her honour powerfully protected:
she had been received into loving communion with a noble
family: she could not help contrasting their soft polished manners
with the rude homely speech and rough demeanour of those with
whom she now was&mdash;far ruder among those mountains, than even
among the people of her own town.</p>

<p>Again, and far above all, that portion of the old old story which
she had heard and believed, when she knew herself to be beloved,
would not be forgotten. It lay at her heart, rankling sometimes
and chafing, because so impossible&mdash;and again was remembered in a
sweet confidence which, though more impossible, was yet inexpressibly
soothing. "He will remember me&mdash;he now thinks of me,"
she would say to herself in the lonely night, when ofttimes a bitter
cry was rung from her, which no one knew of; "and he would
take me away if he could&mdash;ah yes! he would have done it&mdash;if he
could."</p>

<p>From the first moment antipathy was conceived against Tara by
Pudma Bye, that virtuous lady had continued to brood over it with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>
increasing dislike to her. She had tried to excite in her brother
abhorrence for Tara's condition; and, failing that, in Amba Bye,
with whom she had as little success. Both believed Tara to be a
priestess of the goddess whom they feared. The Envoy had tested
her knowledge of sacred books, which was nearly equal to his own,
for he did not pretend, he said, to be a scholar; and in several disputations
with other Brahmuns who, attracted by the news of Tara's
learning, had come to hear her read and recite what she knew, she
had acquitted herself with favourable impressions upon all. But
the woman's hatred of the girl's beauty, and her ascetic austerity,
which would have made Tara like herself, could not be controlled;
and, under the influence of the Shastree, was likely to have full
scope.</p>

<p>But Wittul Shastree could not restrain himself; and, unable to
get speech of the master and mistress of the house, Pudma Bye
was resorted to&mdash;a willing communicator of all that she herself
thought, all that she had said and argued, and all that she had
heard of Tara's sojourn with the impure Mussulmans. As for herself,
she did not, she said, believe Tara's story of Moro Trimmul's
outrage; she, on the contrary, believed what he said, that it was a
meritorious attempt to withdraw her from a scandalous position&mdash;scandalous
alike to herself and to the faith.</p>

<p>The Shastree's mind was at once made up as to his course.
There had been several offensive stories current in regard to young
widows lately, and not without reason: and they had escaped his
punishment. This at least was sure&mdash;the Envoy dare not deny,
and could not evade his power; and if Tara appealed to the Rajah
himself, it would be on a point of caste discipline with which he&mdash;Rajah
though he was&mdash;would not dare to interfere.</p>

<p>"Let us hear her first," he said to the lady, as, having listened
to Pudma Bye's account of Tara, he sat in the outer verandah of
the house the morning after their arrival, while Tara was within;
"wilt thou call her, daughter? we should not judge unheard."</p>

<p>Poor Tara's heart failed her sadly when Pudma called her. She
clung to Amba Bye instinctively, trembling as she saw the priest
sitting without, and protested against meeting him. "He is a
stranger to me; what have I to do with him?" she said. "Let
me go away. I am not his to be questioned, but the Mother's at
Tooljapoor."</p>

<p>"Go," whispered Amba Bye to her; "he is all-powerful here,&mdash;over
the Rajah, over my husband, over all. Go, tell him the truth.
I will not leave thee. Go, Tara."</p>

<p>"Wilt thou now screen her, sister?" cried Pudma Bye, in a
shrill voice, and stretching out her bare skinny arms to Tara. "Is
her shame to be our shame&mdash;we that have no spot or stain upon us?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>
If thou art bewitched, I, that perform the nine penances daily,
should not be exposed to this! Come, girl! it is pollution to touch
thee&mdash;nevertheless, come, else I will drag thee to him."</p>

<p>"Go!" cried Amba, frightened at the other's voice of threat and
scorn combined, of which she had had long and sad experience in
the house. "I dare not keep thee now,&mdash;she is terrible. Go, Tara,
and answer what they ask thee. Say the truth and the Mother
will hear thee. O, that my lord were here! O, that he were here!"
and she sat down, sobbing and wringing her hands helplessly.</p>

<p>"Come," cried Pudma, as, seizing Tara by the arm, she pulled
her forward. "Art thou a child, to be ashamed,&mdash;thou that art a
Moorlee?"</p>

<p>Tara's limbs trembled so that she could hardly move.</p>

<p>"Ah, Mother," she prayed silently, "I am not false to thee yet;
let me not be tried more than I can bear. I will go, even to death,
but not to shame. O Mother, not to shame! Let me go, lady,"
she continued to Pudma Bye, "I will follow thee."</p>

<p>She did so, and, bending down submissively before the priest,
stood up with her hands joined in an attitude of supplication.
For a moment the stern man's features relaxed into an expression
almost of kindness, certainly of extreme interest. The youth of the
girl, her gentle grace, the sad but beautiful expression of her face&mdash;above
all, its purity of expression&mdash;sent conviction to his heart that
there was no room for calumny, none even for suspicion.</p>

<p>Pudma saw the hesitation, and, herself resolute, resumed rapidly
and passionately&mdash;</p>

<p>"Is that a figure to be a widow and a priestess&mdash;that thing with
a golden zone, and necklaces and ear-rings, and a silken garment
like a harlot? Is that a widow who daily combs her hair, braids it,
puts sweet flowers and oils into it, decking it for a lover? O Shastree,
is that what a virtuous widow should be? Is that a condition
of penance and austere privation whereby to inherit life eternal?"</p>

<p>The Shastree's features changed rapidly. "It cannot be," he
said; "such adornment and beauty is not of a virtuous woman.
Now I believe thee, sister, and thy brother must be spoken to. He
cannot keep a thing so offensive in his house, and be among us."</p>

<p>"Hear me, my lord," said Tara, appealing to him piteously. "I
am pure&mdash;I have done no evil&mdash;I am an orphan and a Moorlee, but
not as others; such as I am, the holy Bhartee Swâmi, whom I have
served hitherto, hath made me. Write to him if you will&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What is this?" said Govind Rao, who entered at the moment,
interrupting her; "what art thou asking of her, friend? Let her
alone; she is my care."</p>

<p>"Look," returned the other, rising, "if thou art satisfied to have
one like that remaining in thy house, the Swâmi must know of it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span>
and there will be a fine, and shame will come to thee among the
council. If she be a widow, let her be treated as widows should be.
If&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If I am a Moorlee of the goddess, as ye call me," said Tara,
interposing, "I am already shameless in your eyes, and no widow:
let me go. No Moorlee is asked what she does, or what she wears.
The Mother will not have those near her who are disfigured, and I
cannot break the vow I have made to her; she would destroy me."</p>

<p>Panting and excited, flushed with the desperation of her speech,
Tara stood erect, with her eyes flashing, her glowing beauty exciting
the involuntary admiration of the men, and the virulent hatred of
the woman who sat with them.</p>

<p>"See, brother!" cried Pudma Bye, "look at the witch&mdash;look at
her glowing eyes. It was by these shameless eyes that she won
men's hearts at Tooljapoor. Beware! beware of yourselves, lest ye
too fall! Ah!" she continued with a scream, "put her away&mdash;kill
her; but let her not go&mdash;Brahmun as she is&mdash;to the cow-slayers!"</p>

<p>"Peace," said her brother; "why this spite, Pudma? what hath
she done to thee? Peace, and begone to the inner rooms. Begone!"
he cried in a louder tone, and stamping his foot, "begone! Dost
thou not hear?"</p>

<p>"I hear," she replied doggedly; "but I will not go, unless the
Shastree bid me. Choose now between us: send me out of thy
house to thy shame, and keep her, to thy worse shame; or send her
away. There can be no compromise between good and evil, shame
and dishonour."</p>

<p>"She speaks truly, friend," said the Shastree mildly. "It must
be done. How do we know she is a priestess?"</p>

<p>Tara had not entirely lost the presence of mind which she naturally
possessed, though she found it failing rapidly. "Put me to the
proof," she said quickly,&mdash;"the proof. If there be a temple of the
Mother's here, let me sit in it before her a night and a day&mdash;haply
she may come to her child, as she did at Tooljapoor. Ye can watch
me too, there. If she come not&mdash;then she hath abandoned me, and
ye can kill me if ye please, sirs; better ye did so, for I am indeed
friendless."</p>

<p>"Not so," cried the widow; "thou hast friends, Tara, many and
powerful&mdash;myself the greatest of all; but&mdash;not as thou art. Choose!"</p>

<p>"I have chosen, lady," said the girl sadly. "Take me to the
temple now&mdash;even now,&mdash;and leave me there. A vessel of water is
enough, and a woman to watch me at night, if ye will not watch
yourselves. I have already eaten, and want no food. I would go to
the Mother."</p>

<p>"It is some device, brother," said Pudma suspiciously; "some
device to fly, to escape, or&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span></p>

<p>He smiled and shook his head. "It requires a braver heart than
a girl's to face the mountain-paths alone at night among the bears
and the panthers, sister, and nought but a bird could escape down
the precipices. Why these unjust suspicions? Art thou ready,
Tara? If so, follow me, and thou too, Shastree; we will settle this
matter at once. There is no one now in the Rajah's temple. He
has already paid his devotions, and is preparing to meet the Khan.
Come, the ordinary priests are there, and there is no fear of her.
Come, Tara, fear not. If thou art true, the Mother will defend thee.
Dost thou trust her, girl?"</p>

<p>"Take me to her," she replied. "I have no refuge but with her.
I am ready." Then she turned to embrace Amba Bye, who now
entered sobbing, and fell upon her neck.</p>

<p>"I will come to thee by-and-by," she whispered. "It is but a step,
and I will watch with thee at night. I have a vow to pay to the
Mother. Go with my husband."</p>

<p>We know the place already. It was where Sivaji's mother had
sat. A few words to the attendant priest by Govind Rao and the
Shastree, explained the ordeal to which Tara had voluntarily subjected
herself, and she was permitted to approach the shrine and
make her obeisance and offerings. They watched her, and saw that
she did her office as one used to the duty; and when it was finished,
she went before the shrine, sat down, and began to chant the
morning hymn of the goddess in low and sweet tones, rocking herself
to and fro.</p>

<p>"There can be no doubt of this, Shastree," said Govind Rao,&mdash;"she
is what she tells us."</p>

<p>"She may be," he replied, "but till the goddess comes into her
and speaks by her mouth, she may not be fully believed. Let us
leave her," and they went.</p>

<p>Tara grew absorbed in her devotion: she noticed no one. By-and-by
a gun was fired from a tower near her, and four others
followed. Then a pause ensued, and the priest fed the lamps with
fresh oil, tinkled the bell on the shrine, and poured libations to the
image, renewing these ceremonies with much earnestness. Tara
scarcely noticed them, for though it was broad noonday without, it
was dusk within the closed vestibule. By-and-by a girl, bearing a
tray of lighted lamps, and garlands of flowers, entered, but so that
her face could not be seen, and, delivering some to the priest, began
a ceremony herself, which was strangely familiar; and as Tara
turned her head for an instant, she saw that it was Gunga, and that
she herself was recognized.</p>

<p>Gunga clapped her hands with joy. "At last," she cried excitedly,
"at last! See, I am worshipping for the victory which he
has gained by this time. Hush! thou wilt see Zyna here presently.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>
Moro will bring her captive; then there will be three with him&mdash;I,
and thou, and she. Ha, ha, ha! a merry three, girl. Dost thou
hear, O Tara?" But some strange chill had struck at Tara's heart,
and, sinking down on the floor, for a time she was insensible.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_LXXX" id="CHAPTER_LXXX">CHAPTER LXXX.</a></h2>


<p>Gunga's appearance is easily explained. On his arrival at Pertâbgurh
Moro Trimmul had been sent to bring up some of the Rajah's Hetkurees
from the Concan, the tract below the mountains next the
sea, and he had besought the post of honour in the ensuing attack
upon the Mussulman camp, which had been granted to him.</p>

<p>In this he had two motives: the one, personal distinction, and the
desire of retaliation for Tooljapoor, which was shared commonly
with all Brahmuns; and, secondly, and probably most urgent, the
desire of revenge upon Fazil Khan, and, if possible, the capture of
his sister and family. That either Afzool Khan or his son would
survive the fight, he did not think possible, or if they escaped death,
and were captured, that they would be spared.</p>

<p>Of the Rajah's intentions in regard to the Khan, he had no idea;
and when Maloosray and Palkur were with their prince on the
night preceding the Khan's visit to the fort, Moro Trimmul was
in company with his own men, placing them in positions in the
woods, ready to obey the signal which had been communicated to
him. Gunga, therefore, had been sent on to the fort under charge
of his servants, and directed not only to have the house swept and
prepared, but, as the guns were fired from the fort, to offer sacrifice
for him in the temple, and await his coming.</p>

<p>"Dost thou know her?" asked the Brahmun priest of Gunga,
when he heard her speak to Tara, and observed the effect of her
address.</p>

<p>"Know her?&mdash;Yes, Maharaj," returned Gunga, "she is a Moorlee
of the temple at Tooljapoor, and I am another,&mdash;that's why I know
her."</p>

<p>"It is curious," said the man, musing. "There, raise her up till
my wife comes; we have had charge of her given to us, and she is
to watch here to see if the Mother comes to her to prove herself
what she says she is. Did she ever prophesy?"</p>

<p>"The Mother came to her once," replied Gunga, "when she was
made a Moorlee; but I never saw her come afterwards. If she
would be a true priestess, she perhaps would come; but she is only
half a one at heart, and that's why trouble follows her."</p>

<p>"What trouble?" asked the priest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span></p>

<p>"O, her father and mother are dead, killed in the fight at Tooljapoor,
and she is here, among strangers, with no one to help her; is
not that trouble enough, Maharaj?" replied the girl. "And she is
so beautiful, too; they say she is a witch, and steals men's hearts,
and throws them away; but I don't know that she is&mdash;she is only
beautiful&mdash;look at her."</p>

<p>"Ah, that's the worst I have heard yet," said the man, musing.</p>

<p>"Yes, but she is pure, quite pure, sir," returned Gunga earnestly,
"not like me and the rest of us; and we envied her, and I hated her;
but I don't hate her now, and when she wakes I will tell her so.
Tara, Tara! wake! She is not dead, sir, is she?" continued the
girl dreamily, pushing away Tara's hair from her face, and looking
into her eyes: "she does not answer me. O, speak to her!"</p>

<p>"No, she is alive," replied the Brahmun, feeling her hand and
forehead. "Wait, I will bring some water."</p>

<p>"Would she were dead&mdash;dead ere he came," Gunga muttered to
herself. "He will not spare her now&mdash;ah me! not now: and in the
heat and confusion of victory, who will care for her? All those
she loved last, too, are dead&mdash;all gone&mdash;and that fair boy with the
rest! Ah me, better she died! Tara, drink! here is water!"</p>

<p>A woman came with a brass vessel full, and helped Gunga to raise
her up, while she poured some into her mouth, and sprinkled her
face gently. They saw Tara heave a great sigh; and presently, as
the woman fanned her with the end of her garment, she awoke and
looked dreamily around her&mdash;first to the woman, then to Gunga,
against whom she was reclining. Her first impulse was to rise, but
in the attempt she sank down again, and buried her face in her
hands.</p>

<p>"Why art thou here?" she cried piteously. "O Gunga, go?
leave me." She did not yet comprehend what had been said of
victory, for she made no allusion to it.</p>

<p>"No, Tara, not now," said the girl&mdash;"not now. I will tell thee
why. Go," she continued to the woman. "You are kind. Go
now. I have that to say to my sister which no one must hear. Go!
We are priestesses, and will serve the Mother in our own fashion. But
if I need shelter for her, wilt thou give it?"</p>

<p>"Ah," replied the dame, "we are poor people, and can do little;
but the Máhá Ranee is kind and just&mdash;I will speak to her."</p>

<p>"True," replied Gunga absently; "if needs be, I will come to
thee again&mdash;now, go. Tara!" she continued, stretching out her
hands to her imploringly when the woman had gone out&mdash;"O Tara,
look up! look up, and see if I be like what I was;&mdash;cast me not
away now, for we are both in the like misery! O Mother!" she
cried to the image on the altar, "bid her speak to me, ere it be too
late;&mdash;bid her trust to me, and save herself! Tara, behold I kiss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span>
your feet; trust me now, as I swear on them not to fail you. No,
no, never, never more&mdash;never more, except in death. See what I
do!"</p>

<p>She arose, went to the shrine, and prostrated herself before it on
her face, so that her hands embraced the feet of the image. "O,
kill me, Mother&mdash;O, kill me, Mother!" Tara heard her cry, in a passionate
burst of weeping; "kill me, if thou wilt, for touching thee,
who am not worthy; but hear me, and help me to save Tara. She
is thy child. O, let me save her for thee. I will,&mdash;I will, if thou
wilt bid her trust me, for I am not lying now. I am true to thee and
to her!"</p>

<p>The words were almost inarticulate, and gasped or sobbed, rather
than spoken. They fell strangely on Tara's ears as Gunga still
moaned rather than spoke. "Mother&mdash;O Mother, I am true, I am
not lying; bid her trust me! bid her trust me!"</p>

<p>It was impossible to resist them. Tara rose and went across the
vestibule to her. "Gunga," she said, "get up, I am here: what
wouldst thou of me?"</p>

<p>The girl arose, put away the dishevelled hair from her face, and
again bowed before Tara, embracing her knees. She was not repulsed
this time. The priest had watched the scene wonderingly&mdash;he could
not understand it. Tara was standing beside the door of the shrine,
the light from within streaming out upon her. Her slight figure was
drawn up to its full height, and her beautiful features were calm&mdash;almost
sublime in their expression. Lying at her feet, and clasping
them, was the other girl, still moaning in apparent agony.</p>

<p>"She hath done some terrible crime," thought the Brahmun, "and
the other will intercede for her."</p>

<p>"O Tara&mdash;O Tara," cried Gunga piteously, "I dare not look up to
thee now; all my shame is rushing back into my heart; my words
and my touch are alike pollution to thee! O Tara, I dare not ask
forgiveness&mdash;I who have wronged thee so foully. Speak, for time
passes quickly, and they will be here&mdash;wilt thou trust me now? O
Mother, Mother! what can I do? what can I say to make her trust
me&mdash;to make her forgive me?"</p>

<p>"Look up, Gunga," said Tara, sitting down, and gently parting
the hair on the girl's forehead, "what hast thou done? It was he, not
thou; see, I forgive thee freely."</p>

<p>"O yes, it was he, not I," she cried,&mdash;"I resisted, and he used to
beat me. Yes, he beat me cruelly only yesterday, when he left me,
and then it came into my heart to save thee! Yes, the Mother told
me&mdash;I know it now&mdash;to come here, and I have found thee. Listen!"
she continued, rising, and looking hurriedly about her. "There is no
one near&mdash;all are gone. Come! come! we are not seen;&mdash;come at
once,&mdash;do not delay: we can escape during the confusion. Hark!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span>
they are fighting below&mdash;come! I tell thee the tigers and the bears
on the mountain, are better for me and thee than they. Dost thou
not hear?"</p>

<p>"It is the men firing for the Khan's arrival," said Tara gently;
"there is no fighting. Who should fight?"</p>

<p>"Ah no," cried Gunga, "they are attacked,&mdash;the Khan is already
killed. I heard it as I came in&mdash;they are all dead or dying. O Tara,
I tell thee that no one will escape,&mdash;no, not one. Hark! the din
increases, and thou art here: alas! alas! O Mother! tell it to her,"
she exclaimed, with passionate gesticulation, to the senseless image
before them&mdash;"tell it to her&mdash;she will not believe me&mdash;Tara, dost
thou not hear?"</p>

<p>Just then, an eddy, perhaps, of the mountain-wind, brought up to
them from the deep valley below, a hoarse, confused din of shouts,
shots, and conflict. It could not be mistaken. Tara had heard it
once at Tooljapoor, but this was far more tremendous.</p>

<p>"Come!" again shrieked Gunga, seizing her arm, and dragging
her away&mdash;"come! It is our last chance for life&mdash;do not throw it
away. We can get out and hide among the bushes; and I will never
leave thee, Tara, never."</p>

<p>But she spoke to one now wellnigh bereft of sense. The Khan
killed, the rest attacked, and the fierce turmoil of the fight coming up
stronger and stronger, till the fretted roof of the temple seemed filled
with the sound, overpowered Tara; for at last, the hideous truth
seemed to flash upon her, as she sat down and buried her face in her
lap in an attitude of mute despair; but Gunga would not let her
rest.</p>

<p>"Ah, I am believed now," she cried wildly: "listen! Moro Trimmul,
with thousands upon thousands, has attacked the camp, and he
swore to me to bring the Khan's wife and daughter hither. O Tara!
will he spare them? He swore he would not, and he beat me when I
pleaded for them. Look! here are bruises on me. I tell thee he will
not spare them or you. Come!"</p>

<p>"I will die here,&mdash;I will not go from the Mother, Gunga," replied
Tara. "I am her child now&mdash;only hers: let her do with me as she
wills, I will not go. Save thyself, care not for me," and she arose
and prostrated herself before the shrine. "O Mother," she cried
piteously, "I will not leave thee again. Death or life, what matters
it to me? let it be as thou wilt. I have promised not to leave thee,
and I am here waiting." Then rising, she seated herself as she was
used to do before the shrine, and spoke no more.</p>

<p>"I can at least die with thee, Tara; I will not leave thee," said
Gunga. "Whatever comes, let it come to us both; I am as ready
to die as thou art&mdash;I will not go."</p>

<p>They sat there long. The sun declined, and the evening was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span>
drawing in. Once only Gunga had gone out to see whether she
could gain any intelligence, and had returned saying the doors of
the temple enclosure were shut. The Brahmun priest had disappeared
like the rest, but there were shouts as if of victory which
rung through the building in bursts, evidently growing nearer.
Tara seemed not to hear them. It might be that utter despair
possessed her, or, as Gunga hoped, that some manifestation of the
goddess was about to take place. She scarcely moved now, but
when the shouts grew louder she shuddered, and drew the end of
her garment more closely around her as if she were cold.</p>

<p>It was thus that the Máhá Ranee, Sivaji's mother, found her
and Gunga as she entered with her attendants for the evening
prayer and worship, and to give thanks for the victory.</p>

<p>As the lady had approached the temple, the attendant priest told
her of Tara, and why she had been left there by the Shastree and
Govind Rao, and the tale had excited her curiosity, if not her
compassion.</p>

<p>"She is sitting there before the Mother," he said, "and does not
speak. Perhaps she will answer you, lady, but it seems as though
a fit were coming on her. I will tell her at least that you have
come," and, stepping forward, he advanced to Tara and whispered
in her ear.</p>

<p>The Máhá Ranee followed, and paused as she entered the
vestibule. The light shone full upon Tara, and her expression of
deep misery could not be mistaken. Long afterwards, the first
sight of that pale, wan, despairing face recurred to the lady with
pain, and she never forgot the look of hopeless grief which Tara
had first turned upon her.</p>

<p>"There is no inspiration in that face," said the lady to the
priest,&mdash;"none. It seems to me the Mother hath forsaken her.
Of what is she accused?"</p>

<p>"She was taken from the Mussulman chief, we hear," said the
Brahmun, "and was to have become a Mussulmani. They say,
too, she is a sorceress, and does evil with her eyes; but Govind Rao
placed her here, and knows about her."</p>

<p>"I fear her not," cried the Ranee, with flashing eyes. "Who is
she, that she dare sit in my presence? Put her out! Away with
thee, wench!" she continued to Tara, "get thee hence! If thou
art forsworn, begone! The Mother hath drunk blood to-day, and
will not spare thee! Take her away, Bheemee&mdash;she is an offence
to us."</p>

<p>"Get up, girl," said Bheemee roughly, as she advanced, followed
by several other women&mdash;"get up; dost thou not hear? else we
will cast thee out."</p>

<p>Gunga came forward boldly. "Do not touch or hurt her," she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
said: "I fear she is not now in her right mind. If I may take her,
I will look after her. Get up, Tara," she whispered in her ear:
"come, we will go and hide ourselves. Come, for thy life, come!"
and she tried to lift her up and drag her away.</p>

<p>But Tara could not rise; her limbs seemed paralysed by grief or
terror, and she did not evidently understand what had occurred.
Not noticing the Máhá Ranee, she disengaged herself from Gunga,
and once more stretched out her arms to the shrine before her, and
cried in piteous tones which affected many around her to tears,
"O Mother, I will not leave thee: do with me as thou wilt, even
to death!" and so lay moaning.</p>

<p>"Send for Govind Rao and Wittul Shastree, lady," said the old
Brahmun priest, who was sobbing and wiping his eyes: "they
know of her, and you will hear about her from them."</p>

<p>"Good," replied the Ranee, already softened, "let them be
brought instantly,&mdash;they are without. We will await their
coming."</p>

<p>Some little time elapsed, and others assembled. No one knew
what was going to happen. After a while Tara seemed to regain
sense and to remember why she was there, for she sat up, and they
saw her lips moving as if in prayer. As the trumpets sounded the
setting of the first watch at sunset, and the great kettle-drums and
pipes played the evening music in the Nobut Khana above the gate,
the Brahmun priests entered with the usual offerings, and began to
chant one of the evening hymns of praise, as they moved round
the shrine in time with the faint clash of the silver cymbals, which
one of them carried. Then, timidly and faintly at first, but
increasing in power as she sang, Tara joined the chant. It was an
emotion which she could not restrain, and which not even the sense
of desolation and dull misery which had overwhelmed her, could
repress. She was unconscious of the effect it produced upon those
who listened to her, as her full rich voice rose above the hoarse and
unmusical chant of the priests; but as it gradually ceased, and the
sound died away in the recesses of the temple, it affected many of
those who heard it to tears, and was never forgotten.</p>

<p>"No wonder," said the Ranee, who had listened to the hymn
with emotion which she hardly chose to acknowledge,&mdash;"no wonder
they say she is a sorceress. See, she has no fear&mdash;no perception
of what is to happen, or who are around her. That is not natural;
it is magic, and may not be looked upon."</p>

<p>"Lady," said Wittul Shastree, who, with Govind Rao and the
other Brahmuns, now approached her, "we attend you; what are
your commands?"</p>

<p>"We doubt the girl yonder, and they tell us she is dangerous,
and a sorceress; we would have her removed ere we render sacrifice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span>
for victory," she replied; "but the priests tell us she is there by
your order. Is it so?"</p>

<p>"By her own will," said the Shastree; "not our orders. We
would have made her over to the council for chastisement and
discipline, because, as a priestess of Kalee, she hath been residing
among the Moslems; but she claimed ordeal and sanctuary with the
goddess, and we sent her here. Has any vision appeared to her?"
he asked of the attendant priest.</p>

<p>"None," replied the man. "They have been talking together,
she and the girl beside her, who wanted her to get up and go away;
but she has not stirred since the five guns were fired, and she was
told of the victory."</p>

<p>"I will ask her again what she wishes, lady," said Govind Rao,
"but better than I, Moro Trimmul should do it, who, we hear, has
married his sister to her father. He, too, is without with the Rajah;
they have just come up into the fort."</p>

<p>"Let him be called," replied the lady, "and keep out other
strangers. Be ye all seated, sirs," she continued to the Brahmuns
who had accompanied the Shastree, "while this inquiry lasts."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_LXXXI" id="CHAPTER_LXXXI">CHAPTER LXXXI.</a></h2>


<p>The inner part of the vestibule was not large,&mdash;a square room,
supported upon massive stone pillars at the corners, with a slightly
raised dais all round; and as the Brahmuns entered and took their
seats, Tara could not avoid noticing them, and appeared more conscious
of surrounding occurrences than before. Thinking she would
rise, Gunga approached to assist her, but Tara motioned her away.
"My time is not yet come," she said; "I will not go;" and again
she drew her garment about her, and resumed her silent position.</p>

<p>But not for long. There was a sudden movement among those
without, and a way was cleared for one who came in rapidly.</p>

<p>"Who wants me here?" cried a strong manly voice, apparently
hoarse from shouting. "A girl! what girl? Let me pass."</p>

<p>As he strode in through the men who were sitting behind, Tara
turned her head, and suddenly beheld her enemy.</p>

<p>She rose at once, excited and defiant, so noble in her manner, so
expressive in her abhorrence, that Moro Trimmul shrank back a
step, abashed.</p>

<p>"Begone!" she cried, stamping her foot. "There is the Mother;
not a second time shalt thou take me from her. My fathers," she
cried, appealing to all around, "he would twice have dishonoured
me, and I have been saved. Now I am under your protection, O, give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>
me not to him! Take me to the mother of the Rajah; she will
protect me."</p>

<p>"She is here," said the Shastree, stepping forward; "and thy
fate shall be decided before her. Fear not, daughter."</p>

<p>"Friends," said Moro Trimmul, looking round, "have care for my
honour! Twice have I rescued her from shame. Once when she
was escaping from Tooljapoor; once in separating her from those
who have been slain. Give her to me, for her shame to be hidden
away for ever."</p>

<p>"I will not go; I will not go!" cried Tara, entering the door of
the shrine, and clasping the feet of the image. "Kill me if ye will,
here,&mdash;I am ready; but I will not go with him."</p>

<p>"I claim them both, sirs," cried Moro Trimmul passionately;
"her, and her sister Moorlee yonder. Beware, all of ye, how ye
interfere with the family honour of a respectable man. I will brook
it from no one, not even from Sivaji Bhóslay himself! Have I won
a victory to-day at the Mother's command, and am I to be disgraced
and humbled before her, by a deranged girl and doting priests, ere
it is closed? Come forth, Tara!" he called, in a hoarse voice&mdash;"come
forth, else I will tear thee thence. Away with her," he cried
to two of his attendants, who had seized Gunga, and were holding
her fast&mdash;"away with her to my house, and bind her there; I will
bring the other. Now, friends, beware who stays me, for, by the
gods, he dies, be he who he may!" and he drew his sword, and was
advancing, when the Shastree stepped before him.</p>

<p>"Madman," he cried, stretching forth his hands; "forbear! put
up thy weapon,&mdash;no one here dreads it. We are Brahmuns, as
thou art! Fear not," he continued to Tara, who had stood up also
by the altar, and was trembling violently, but not with terror.
"Fear not; thou art under the protection of the council, and he
dare not interfere with thee."</p>

<p>"Fool and dotard," exclaimed Moro Trimmul under his breath,
and from between his clenched teeth, "I will settle with thee for
this, one day yet. As ye will, sirs," he continued bitterly, looking
round and panting as he dropped his sword's point. "My honour
is in the hands of a priest's council at last, not in my own keeping,
and I am helpless; but hasten what ye have to do, for I will not
leave ye till ye have decided in regard to her. Look at her&mdash;harlot
and witch, sorceress and devil&mdash;who hath already destroyed men's
souls,&mdash;will ye believe the Mother protects such as she is?"</p>

<p>"Let it be so," said the Shastree. "Tara, art thou willing to
abide the night, as the issue of the ordeal suggested by thyself, to
wait her coming? If so, we will stay here with thee."</p>

<p>"Mother," she said in a low voice, turning to the altar, and
joining her hands in supplication before the image&mdash;"Mother, if I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span>
am thy child, tell me what to say to them; or, if thou wilt, let me be
another sacrifice to thee, and it will be well. Mother,&mdash;O Toolja
Máta! dost thou hear?&mdash;Tara is ready before thee&mdash;ready to come!"</p>

<p>Low as the words were spoken, they were heard by all; and
remembering the events of the day, and believing in the power of
the goddess, it was expected the girl would fall and die where she
was, on the solemn invocation; but it was not so. For a few
moments she stood gazing intently at the image, without altering
her position of supplication; then she smiled, her hands dropped,
and she turned at once and faced the assembly. Not even in her
first office as priestess had her beauty been more glorious&mdash;the expression
of her features more sublime.</p>

<p>"O priests and elders," she said calmly and simply, in her sweet
musical voice, "hear my last words: I am an orphan and a widow,
I have no one left on earth to protect me,&mdash;not one. To be in danger
of that man's evil designs, is to die, hourly. Did he succeed as he
has tried, it would be to live in shame; now I can die in purity.
The Mother calls me; she will not come to me, though I have asked
her. She is far from me, yet she beckons to me; look, there!" and
she stretched forth her hand to the roof&mdash;"she calls me, and I come,
pure, and purified by fire. Now listen, all ye Brahmuns; I am true
and pure, and I am sutee henceforth. When ye will, and where ye
will, I am sutee; and on his head be curses, and the vengeance of
Kalee, who forbids it. Let me die in the fire, and I am happy!
What she puts into my mouth, I say to you truly. Let no one
forbid it."</p>

<p>No one spoke, no one answered. The people before her rose as
one man. Many trembled, some wept, and women screamed aloud;
but Tara stood there unmoved, her bosom heaving rapidly, and the
glowing beauty and rapture of her face unchanged.</p>

<p>"Jey Kalee! Jey Toolja Máta!" exclaimed the Shastree; "let it
be as she says, brothers. Henceforth she is sutee, and we accept
the sacrifice, for the Mother hath said it by her lips. Ah, the ordeal
is fulfilled indeed, and to the honour of her votary! Fear not," he
said, "daughter: by this act is thy husband delivered from hell;
and all thou hast suffered in this life is sanctified unto thee. Bring
flowers, bring garlands," he cried to the people; "crown her here at
the altar, and let her be worshipped."</p>

<p>"Tara, Tara!" cried a husky voice close to her, entreatingly;
"Tara, what hast thou done? Art thou mad? O girl, why hast
thou doomed thyself? Come, there is yet time: come with me!"</p>

<p>"Begone!" cried the girl, interrupting him; "I spurn thee, Moro
Trimmul, before all these elders: false and cruel as thou art, I am at
last beyond thy reach!"</p>

<p>"Come away, Moro," said Maloosray roughly, who had just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span>
entered, and dragged him backwards with one hand, while he seized
his sword and wrested it from him with the other; "art thou a
child? dost thou fight with priests and women? Come with me;
the Rajah calls thee." The Brahmun struggled to be free, but
Tannajee's powerful arms were about him, in which he was borne
away, helpless to resist.</p>

<p>Not in her first admission to the office she had held, not in the
holiest of ceremonies at which she had before assisted, was greater
honour ever done to Tara than now. Bedecked with garlands, with
incense burnt before her, the priests present formed themselves into
a procession, and, chanting hymns of praise, led her round and round
the shrine. The temple court and its precincts were now filled with
people, who took up the shouts of victory&mdash;"Jey Kalee! Jey Toolja
Máta!" and as she passed onwards, throwing handfuls of flowers
among them, all who could reach her, touched her garments reverently,
or prostrated themselves before her, with frantic cries for
blessings. And so they led her on.</p>

<p>How many sweet memories crowded into Tara's mind now, and
urged her on. There was no fear, no irresolution&mdash;father, mother,
Zyna, Fazil&mdash;all dead, as she thought, and a fierce and ruthless
enemy persecuting her to the last. All she could think on was, that
she was free, that no one could harm her now. Had they then led
her to death, she would have gone, singing the hymns triumphantly.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Late that night Moro Trimmul returned to his place of residence.
Long before, when Sivaji's power was in its infancy, and the young
men had taken possession of the mountain-built fort, and led their
bands forth to plunder and destroy the Mahomedan villages around,
Moro Trimmul had fitted up a hollow bastion on one of the angles of
the precipice&mdash;in which the builder had left a small room and
anteroom&mdash;as his place of shelter. The inside was rudely plastered
with clay; and a sleeping-place, also of clay, had been raised from
the floor, on which was placed a mattress and pillow. In the face of
the bastion a small oriel window had been built, which had a balcony
projecting from the wall, large enough for two people to sit in.
Seated there, you looked down a dizzy depth upon the forest below;
but on all sides the precipices, the woods, and their deep glens, and
the varied mountains beyond, formed a combination of glorious
beauty, which there, above all other places in the mountain fortress,
was most deeply felt.</p>

<p>Thither had Gunga been taken by the Brahmun's servants on the
morning of the battle. He had charged them to have the place
swept and newly plastered with clay, and Gunga, with having it
done as he wished. On its completion, she had gone into the temple
to worship for him in the exercise of her vocation, as the signal was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span>
to be given, which they all told her of. She knew of his design.
He had charged her to watch Tara, and, if she saw her, to give him
information of her actions. He had told her that he should bring
Fazil's sister to the fort, for he felt sure she could not escape him.
Herself, Zyna, and Tara should be confronted at last. How long
should the latter elude him? For the Khan, Gunga cared nothing;
for Zyna and Fazil as little&mdash;they were Mussulmans, and must perish,&mdash;but
for Tara!</p>

<p>Ah yes, strange indeed, perhaps, yet not unnatural, had been the
revulsion. The jealousy which had urged Gunga to hate the girl,
and assist in plots for her ruin, had strangely altered to love. Twice
had Moro Trimmul been foiled; twice he had fallen savagely upon
her, and beaten her cruelly. We know when he did when Tara was
last rescued, and how Gunga, relenting, had not then abandoned
him. But it had not ended there. The fierce rage of disappointment
had broken out again and again, and he had vented it upon
her brutally. She had borne this patiently at the time; but she had
now sworn to herself, in the temple of the goddess at Wye, not only
to lend herself no more to Moro Trimmul's design, but had formed
the resolution to assist Tara to escape&mdash;to carry her off by mountain
paths; and she knew that if they could once enter the forest near
the fort, they were safe.</p>

<p>Day by day, as these thoughts passed through Gunga's mind, the
love for Tara grew stronger, till it became an absorbing passion.
Would she but trust her&mdash;would she but believe her&mdash;they might
yet again see their beloved Tooljapoor, and she would work out her
forgiveness by devotion. It was not too late, she thought: but....</p>

<p>We have already told how she met her in the temple: but it is
impossible to describe her despair at her failure to induce Tara to
escape, or when the man she dreaded, bid his servants seize and bind
her. If she could have remained with Tara&mdash;only near her....</p>

<p>Alas! it was too late now. She had scarcely been carried, shrieking,
from the temple, by the servants of Moro Trimmul, when
another man followed, and said Tara had become a Sutee, and was
to be burnt next day beside the tank in the fort. Then Gunga felt
the heroism of the girl's resolution. At least Moro Trimmul could
not injure her; she would soon be beyond reach of his persecution.
It was well&mdash;yes, it was well. She could at least see her die; and
then?...</p>

<p>The desire of death sat hard at her heart. At first she shuddered
at it; but once it had entered, it abode there and grew stronger.
If Moro Trimmul cast her off now, it would be but to be haunted
by the memory of the girl she had wronged so cruelly, and the love
for whom, and the despair of whose forgiveness, had pursued her
night and day&mdash;night and day: but it seemed to have reached her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span>
at last. "Yes, she touched me kindly," she said to herself; "she
parted the hair from my face as a sister would have done: ere she
spoke to me she forgave me: and I will see her die, decked in flowers,
as a holy and pure sacrifice. I will worship her as she goes to death,
and then I will follow her. O Tara, there, not here, I may be forgiven
before the Mother."</p>

<p>Moro Trimmul's servants had taken Gunga, and literally obeyed
the orders they had received; bound her with one of her own garments,
lest she should do herself or them injury, and laid her gently
upon the couch in the inner room. How long she had lain there she
had no idea; but, as the time passed, it only confirmed her resolution.
She would die, no matter how. There was nothing definite in her
mind, but that she would die: a dull despair blunting every faculty&mdash;a
reality of determination before which her very senses seemed to
refuse office.</p>

<p>She heard Moro Trimmul ask without where she was, and the
servant answered that she was within, lying on the couch. A small
lamp had been lighted and placed in a niche; and as he entered and
stood over her, she feigned sleep. She felt him unfasten the bandage
round her arms, and then he dragged her roughly to her feet.</p>

<p>"Devil!" he cried, "this is thy doing, and she is gone. Lost!
O Tara, how beautiful thou wast in living death!" he continued,
apostrophizing her, "speaking thy own death-sentence&mdash;as I listened,
I could have died for thee."</p>

<p>"Thou art a coward, Moro Trimmul," cried the girl, scornfully
and desperately; "thou darest neither die thyself, nor kill me.
Thou die with Tara? she would spit at thee, as I do."</p>

<p>He struck her brutally to the ground with his clenched hand.
"Lie there, witch! devil!" he cried. "Thou hast been the cause
of all this; alone, I could have done it. Thou and she are one now,
else why didst thou not decoy her here? Did I not tell thee to do
so? Speak!" and he pushed her with his foot as she lay.</p>

<p>She arose. "Moro Trimmul," she said calmly, but with desperation
in her voice, "may the Mother forgive me what I have done
with thee against Tara; that is all I pray now. Between me and
thee all is ended, long since. Let me go. I will serve thee no longer,
I spit at thee and defy thee; and in the Rajah's court, before every
image of Kalee in the Dekhan, if I live, I will sing thy shame and
her honour. Let me go out!"</p>

<p>She saw him set his teeth, as his eyes flashed with a wicked glare,
draw a knife from his waist-band, and spring at her. The glitter of
that knife was the last thing, perhaps, of which she was conscious,
except that she seized the hand that held it, instinctively, and then
came a struggle for life. But only a brief one. A weak girl, before
a powerful man, could not endure long,&mdash;sickened, too, as she was by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span>
his previous blow. Back&mdash;back, he forced her to the window, which
was open; on the little balcony without, they swayed to and fro
fearfully for a moment; but he wrenched his hand free by a desperate
effort, and, striking her one heavy blow with the knife, where
he knew not,&mdash;as the body dropped heavily in his arms, he pushed
it forth into the dark air. He did not hear it fall, though he listened;
but in the morning, the vultures, which lived on pinnacles of the
precipices, were seen descending in hundreds to their hideous feast
below.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_LXXXII" id="CHAPTER_LXXXII">CHAPTER LXXXII.</a></h2>


<p>Fazil Khan had followed the progress of his father up the mountain-side
with intense interest. The little pavilion on the knoll, the group
of Brahmuns already there, and the open and nearly level spot which
had been selected as the place of meeting, were distinctly visible
from where he stood with Bulwunt Rao, and a few other of his
trusty associates and retainers. Around, the horsemen&mdash;now mostly
dismounted&mdash;were dispersed in picturesque groups, talking together
or lying lazily upon the soft sward holding their horses' bridles, and
shading their eyes from the sun.</p>

<p>In the town through which his father had gone, there appeared no
stir. A few men were lounging about the gate, and upon the bastion
near it, and thus were looking out upon the Moslem horsemen
apparently in idle curiosity. The gate was open, and the townspeople,
and women with jars of water on their heads, were passing
to and fro unconcernedly as usual. There was nothing to excite
suspicion or apprehension, except in the mode of reception of his
father, and the strange, unusual proposition, that the first interview
should be on the mountain-side, and alone; but Bulwunt Rao had
explained this characteristically, and with a fair show of reason, and
Fazil, though uneasy, was obliged to be content: there was no remedy
now.</p>

<p>So the Khan's progress in his palankeen had been watched with
intense anxiety as he ascended the rugged pathway. At times the
bearers could be seen, and the priest holding the side of the litter to
help himself along: again the thick foliage, and turns in the road,
hid them from view. At length Fazil saw the Brahmuns on the knoll
rise and advance a few steps, and the palankeen emerge upon the
open space, where it was set down; and his father got out, adjusted
his turban and shawl, and stood with the rest. Then the bearers
and the priest moved a little aside; and as the two men from above
appeared, his father advanced to meet them, and embraced one.</p>

<p>It was but for a moment, and the fatal result was at once apparent.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span>
With a cry of horror, which aroused many around him who had not
been watching the proceedings above, Fazil saw his father reel and
fall, rise again, as his sword flashed in the air, and with the Peer
maintain the unequal combat we have already described. No sound
reached those below; they could only see the flashing of the weapons
in the sun, and the struggle of the combatants. Involuntarily, Fazil
urged on his horse. Alas! of what avail now? Others had been
watching as well as he; and the blast of the horn, which rose shrill
and quivering as the Khan fell, was answered by volleys of matchlock
shots from the woods around. The gates of the town were
shut, and the walls and bastions manned as thickly as men could
stand on then, whose fire on the horsemen below was hot and
deadly.</p>

<p>The effect of the surprise upon the helpless cavaliers need not be
detailed. Panic-stricken, and hemmed in on every side, they rode
hither and thither, vainly seeking places of egress through the woods,
or by the way they came, and were shot down in scores either where
they stood, or as they gathered in groups and charged hither and
thither in the vain attempt to reach a foe. Among these, Fazil
Khan, with Bulwunt Rao and some others, had kept together; and,
in the emergency, Bulwunt's clear perception, not only of the danger,
but the best means of extrication from it, saved his young master.
On the first perception of his father's fate, Fazil had seen that it was
impossible to give help. The town and its walls stood between him
and the ascent to the fort, and were utterly impassable. His next
idea, in his grief and desperation, was to die with his men as martyrs
to the faith; and he was about to dismount, and take his chance on
foot, when Bulwunt stopped him.</p>

<p>"No, Meah," he cried, "not while there is hope. They who will
be helpless indeed without you, will need you yonder in camp. If it
must be, I will die with you, but not now. Follow me, and we will
soon join them."</p>

<p>Well was it for Fazil Khan that in his retainer he possessed equally,
a devoted friend and one who had known the country as a youth.
In his recent visit to the fort, Bulwunt Rao had explored some of
his old haunts. One pathway, lying near that by which they had
come, was hardly visible from the plain, but if it could be gained, it
opened out afterwards into a long glade, which joined the main-road
below. It might be guarded, and they could but fight their way
through it or fall. Certainly it was better than the way they had
come, before which, from the deadly fire maintained there, the horsemen
had already fallen in a heap.</p>

<p>"Look," continued Bulwunt Rao, pointing to the entrance to the
main-road, "there is no hope there. They have been at their old
trick of felling trees across it, and no horse can pass. The Abyssinians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span>
have fallen in a heap, and if we try, we shall but follow them.
We need not be martyrs yet, Meah," he laughed cheerfully. "Now,
set your teeth, my sons," he continued to the men around, "and
follow me. We may not all get through; but, Bismilla! come, and
let God take whom he pleases."</p>

<p>There might have been fifty men; and others, as many more
perhaps,&mdash;as they saw these ride together in a desperate race in one
direction,&mdash;joined them. Bulwunt Rao and Fazil were leading; and
as they approached what seemed a portion of impervious wood, Fazil's
heart failed him for a moment. "You are wrong, Bulwunt Rao,"
he cried. "We cannot get through this&mdash;let us turn."</p>

<p>"Madman!" exclaimed the other, seizing the bridle of his horse.
"By your mother and sister, I swear I am right! Follow me, my
children," he shouted, looking back, while he again urged his horse
to its utmost speed; "we are near now."</p>

<p>He was right. A portion of the jungle jutted out beyond the rest,
and made a slight shoulder, as it were, behind which was the path.
As they turned round the corner, they saw a body of foot-soldiers
drawn up across it; but ere these could raise their matchlocks to
fire, the impetuous horsemen were among them, trampling some
down, and hewing fiercely at others with their long Spanish swords.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
The attack was irresistible, and, the first line of men forced, they
encountered no others. Straggling shots were fired at them from the
sides of the mountain, but without effect; and after riding nearly a
mile down the glade at the same speed, the pathway turned into the
main-road, and they heard the din of the fight die away behind them.
Of the fifteen hundred gallant cavaliers who had ridden that morning
from the camp at Jowly, they were the only survivors.</p>

<p>While Nettajee Palkur was finishing his bloody work on those who
remained after Fazil Khan's escape, by closing up the pathway, and
attacking from all sides at once, such of the horsemen as remained
in the field,&mdash;Moro Trimmul was busy with his part of the general
slaughter; and as the fugitives rode on, the din of the fight behind
growing fainter as they proceeded, they were met by that of the
greater work in front,&mdash;more furious, and more terrible.</p>

<p>Yet they pressed on, until, reaching a rising-ground which overlooked
the field, they could see it all in its hideous reality. The
Mahrattas had seized the Beejapoor guns, and that point of defence
no longer remained to the Mahomedans. Thousands of the enemy's
footmen, in compact masses, were charging disordered groups of
men huddled together, who made a vain resistance. Great numbers
of horses were careering madly about, but, for the most part, the
troop-horses were still at their pickets, and were now protected by
the Mahrattas. It was evident that the surprise had been as complete
and irretrievable as at the fort.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span></p>
<p>Casting his eyes round this field, in sickening apprehension&mdash;indeed,
in almost hopeless despair&mdash;the young Khan looked towards
the tents where he had left his sister and Lurlee. The tents were
standing, but the outer enclosure walls were thrown down, and a
crowd of followers and soldiers were apparently struggling together
in the plunder of what they contained. The place was apart from
the field itself, and Fazil pointed to it; he could not speak.</p>

<p>The men with him had had no time for thought. From the
moment the Khan had died at Pertâbgurh till they drew rein on the
eminence over the camp, they had ridden for life. But the worst
was now evident; and what they had hoped to find, was gone. The
conviction that all their companions,&mdash;those whom they had loved
in life, were dead, at once fell upon their hearts; and Bulwunt Rao,
and many another rough veteran, burst into passionate weeping.</p>

<p>Fazil appeared calm, but it was the calm of desperation and of
misery. "Why do you weep, friends?" he said. "They are all
dead; why should we live? Death is better than dishonour! Come
and see&mdash;Bismilla!"&mdash;and he turned his horse's head in the direction
of the tents.</p>

<p>None thought of the risk. "Bismilla!" shouted the men, as, with
teeth hard set for a last struggle in life, they rode a mad race to
their old camp. Near it they passed many a familiar face lying
upturned to the sun; and, hewing their way through a crowd of
plunderers which were upon the area that had been covered by the
Khan's tents, Fazil saw that their walls were torn down, and that no
one remained; and in the bed of the rivulet which, lying low, screened
them from observation, they drew rein. In his misery Fazil would
have dismounted, and again sought death on foot, but Bulwunt Rao
saw the intention, and prevented it, as he had done before.</p>

<p>"No, no, Meah," he said roughly; "you are our master now;
and as the gods have enabled me to save you once to-day, so we will
all try again. If they you sought have been taken, they are in
honourable safety with the Rajah: if they are dead, there is no help
but in submission to God's will."</p>

<p>A shout from several of the men caused Fazil to look round. He
saw some persons running towards the party who had emerged from
the thick jungle on the other side of the stream. They were grooms
who had hidden themselves.</p>

<p>One of them clasped Fazil's knees. "They are safe," he cried;
"Meah, they are gone this way with the hunchback and Ashruf, who
would not let us follow lest we should be seen. They went down the
river; and see! here are their tracks. Come!"</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span></p>

<p>What need to speak more now? The new interest absorbed all
other considerations. Several of the grooms were good trackers,
and the hoof-marks of the two ponies could not be mistaken. They
knew them well.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon&mdash;often bewildered in deep silent forests, often
thrown out, often despairing of success, often passing hard rocky
ground where Fazil could see no tracks whatever, but where Bulwunt
Rao and the trackers held their way with confidence, a small group
of people were discovered, from a knoll where the trackers stood for
a time uncertain, sitting near a large banian tree, on the bank of a
mountain stream.</p>

<p>At a little distance, too, from them, sat a few men armed with
matchlocks, who were apparently guarding the rest.</p>

<p>Fazil and the scouts approached, cautiously leading his horse; and
the first greeting was a rough one from the guards, who raised their
guns to fire; but the next, a frantic cry of welcome from the
hunchback and Ashruf, who ran forward and prostrated themselves
before him.</p>

<p>"O Meah, they are safe&mdash;they are safe!" cried Lukshmun, rising
first. "Come and see," he cried, bursting into tears; "and the gods
have sent thee."</p>

<p>Hearing his cry, Goolab rushed forward, clasping his knees, and,
unable to speak, was sobbing passionately.</p>

<p>Yes, they were safe&mdash;Lurlee and Zyna. A rude bower of leafy
branches had been hastily made, with a screen of boughs twisted into
stakes in front; and so concealed were they by the thick brushwood,
apart from the grassy glade, that the little commotion which Fazil's
coming had caused, had not been heard by them. Having dismounted,
and preceded by old Goolab, who, in her uncontrollable joy, now ran
before, screaming the news of his arrival, he entered the enclosure&mdash;and
the two desolate women, whose utter despair nothing as yet had
soothed or alleviated, fell upon his neck and wept aloud.</p>

<p>How long they sat into the night they could not tell. Kakrey, the
Mahratta officer who had followed the party by Moro Trimmul's
order, had overtaken them; and, touched by the beauty and sorrow
of the women, had not molested them. The nearest Mahomedan garrison
was Kurrar, a town at some distance; but he had engaged to
guide and protect them thither, and the reward promised by Lurlee
was at once confirmed, and even enhanced by Fazil. Kakrey had
already told them that the Khan's escape was impossible; and they
were thus prepared for the sad news which Fazil brought.</p>

<p>Kakrey decidedly objected, however, to Fazil's horsemen, and even
to Lukshmun and Ashruf; they were strangers, and would be inevitably
suspected. Fazil and his men must take another road, he
said; and the ladies must submit to hardships among mountain villages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span>
and rough tracks for some days. They had no other chance of
escape but in disguise, and alone with him. He had already procured
rough food and coarse clothes, and there was little time for
rest; ere the morning he must take them away.</p>

<p>Poor Lurlee! All night while Fazil sat there, she had pored over
the book of astrological diagrams in a hopeless puzzle of mind.
Why should she have been mistaken? Why should her husband
have died who had left her so hopeful in the morning? Were they
all wrong? was all this, the faith of her life, false?</p>

<p>It seemed so; but one thing was at least certain, that Tara's nature
and Fazil's were alike; and she appeared, in spite of her grief, to
return to this discovery with a peculiar zest. "I am not wrong," she
said, "in this; look!"&mdash;but we will spare the detail. She was too
much bewildered by far, to understand as yet the loss that had befallen
her, nor was she at all convinced that she was a widow. No,
the stars could not be wrong; and for all they could say, she only
believed the more that the Khan would return. "Who had seen
him die?"</p>

<p>Fazil was convinced of Kakrey's good faith. Bulwunt Rao unhesitatingly
answered for him. They were neighbours, and had been
boys together. Fazil's promises of reward were too profuse to have
aught in competition with them. It was hard to persuade Zyna that
he must leave her again; but as they were situated, they could not
remain together, and must separate. For Fazil would not leave his
men, and he determined, with Bulwunt and the hunchback, to hover
as long as possible about the vicinity of Wye. He might be joined by
other fugitives, he might rescue many of his people, and even make
head against the enemy; above all, perhaps he might get news of
Tara, and assist her. He should avoid the Mahratta horse, and with
a guide like Bulwunt Rao, and one of Kakrey's followers, who volunteered
to accompany him, he could either conceal himself or advance
as needful.</p>

<p>So, with many tears, and almost despairing, Lurlee and Zyna,
dressed as peasant women in the coarsest clothes, left him ere morning
dawned. Lurlee was not remarkable; but the fair skin and
beautiful features of Zyna were often objects of wondering interest
and admiration among the mountain peasantry, as they journeyed on.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Three days afterwards, Fazil and his men, who had been joined
by other stragglers on foot and on horseback, were lying during the
day in the place of concealment which had been chosen by Kakrey's
follower, and approved of by Bulwunt Rao and the hunchback.
In the depth of the jungle near Wye, there was a large banian tree,
planted by a small temple now deserted, because of some evil repute.
The tree had flourished while the temple had decayed, and was large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span>
enough, with its offsets, to have sheltered thousands. The outside
boughs trailed on the ground, screening everything within, where
the bare, gaunt branches, and the naked roots falling from them, rose
high into the air, covered above with a thick foliage. A bright rill
sparkled past the tree; grass was abundant on the hill-sides, and a
liberal price for grain had induced some villagers near, to supply the
men's wants for a few days. Every day, the hunchback and the boy
Ashruf, disguising themselves as mendicants, had sung ballads in
the town of Wye, in order to gain information of passing events.</p>

<p>They were lying concealed in this hiding-place when, in the
afternoon of the third day, the hunchback broke in upon Fazil and
some others sitting together. "Bid them all go away," he cried excitedly;
"I have strange news, Meah, for thee,&mdash;for thine ear only."</p>

<p>The men rose and went to a distance. "Can it be of his father?"
they said.</p>

<p>No, it was not of him; he was beyond all hope now, and his
bloody head festering in the sun above the gate of Pertâbgurh.</p>

<p>"Meah," said the man, in a low voice, "Tara the Moorlee is
alive, but they are going to burn her to-morrow; and I saw them
taking wood to the river-side to make the pile. They say the goddess
came to her at Pertâbgurh, and told her, before the Rajah, to be
a Sutee, and he is going to make a great show of her to the people.
I waited till I saw her come into Wye in a palankeen, and I would
have told her you were here, but I could not get near her for the
crowd&mdash;they were throwing flowers upon her. The people do not
know her name, but I knew her: it is Tara. O Meah, you will not
let the Brahmuns do this!"</p>

<p>"By Alla and the Prophet, no!" cried the young man, starting to
his feet. "Dost thou know the place?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I can lead a Duróra on the house," said Lukshmun hesitatingly.
"God forgive me, it is not the first I have led, and I observed
it all before I left."</p>

<p>"Where is Bulwunt Rao? Call him."</p>

<p>"He is asleep," replied Lukshmun; "I will go and bring him."</p>

<p>"Meah wants you; come," he said to Bulwunt Rao, after waking
him; and when he joined Fazil, all was told him; and the three men
consulted long and earnestly as to how the girl might be rescued.</p>

<p>"O, were but Rama and a score of Pahar Singh's Ramoosees
here," said Lukshmun, "we could go and bring her to you to-night,
without waking her; but your Mussulmans would make but a poor
hand of that work."</p>

<p>So, after discussing the subject in every way, there seemed no
chance of success but in an effort to carry her off from the pile
itself. The attempt might succeed or fail; but the men who would
undertake it were at least desperate, and to abandon the girl to her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span>
fate without endeavouring to rescue her, was not to be thought of.
In any case, they must leave their hiding-place on the morrow, or
starve. A long march might take them at once beyond the disturbed
country; and they were not, in their present mood, likely to
falter in their project.</p>

<p>Tara! Her name aroused a thousand sweet memories. The day
after the interview with the Rajah, she was to have been demanded
as a subject of their King; and, in the Rajah's apparently submissive
mood, Fazil had anticipated no refusal. What had happened to
place her in the situation in which she was, he could not conjecture;
but Bulwunt Rao and Lukshmun understood at once that she was the
victim of Brahmun intrigues excited by Moro Trimmul, and rejoiced
in the prospect of frustrating his intentions. Finally, the whole
project was explained to the men; and in their hearty acquiescence,
and in the excitement of a new and desperate action, the young Khan
lay down that night, and, for the first time since the slaughter, slept
soundly.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_LXXXIII" id="CHAPTER_LXXXIII">CHAPTER LXXXIII.</a></h2>


<p>Meanwhile, the Shastree, Anunda, and Radha, were pressing on as
fast as the nature of their travelling would allow. The Shastree
had a palankeen, for he was still weak, and the women rode; but as
he gained strength, he was able to ride in turn.</p>

<p>At first their stages were necessarily short, with frequent halts;
but as they proceeded, they had increased the daily distance; and
the news of the action at Pertâbgurh, which had spread over the
country with incredible rapidity, made them more and more anxious
to reach Wye, and ascertain Tara's fate. All attempts to trace her
on the road were fruitless. The army had passed, but in the confusion
attendant upon its progress, individuals could not be traced or
distinguished.</p>

<p>At the last stage before Wye they found the village where they
rested in much excitement. It was understood that a Sutee would
take place in the town the next day; and though it was not known
who the person was, the certainty that such a ceremony would occur
was beyond question; and it was evident that people from all the
country round would attend it.</p>

<p>Anunda had not been at Wye since her youth. Her parents,
who had resided there, were long since dead, and she knew, vaguely
only, of some distant relatives. The Shastree, however, in his professional
expeditions, had frequently visited the town which, from
the number of Brahmun families residing there, was then, as it still
is, the seat of much learning, and, from its many temples on the
bank of the Krishna river, esteemed sacred.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span></p>

<p>The chief priest of one of those temples, Vishnu Pundit, was an
old friend and antagonist in scientific and literary discussions, and
Vyas Shastree knew he was sure of a hearty welcome, even if his
coming were not formally announced. But considering that his
wives might be an inconvenience, he had sent a note on by a
messenger, who had engaged to deliver it by daylight at furthest;
and as they set out for their last march, it was in hopeful, perhaps
joyful anticipation of news of Tara, by which their long suspense
would be ended.</p>

<p>Mingling with the parties, therefore, which thronged the roads to
the town, and hearing many speculations as to the nature of the
Sutee, but nothing definite, the travellers passed on as rapidly as
possible; and a fairer scene than the bed of the sacred stream, with
its hundreds of bathers in the sparkling waters, the temples on its
banks, and the broad flights of steps leading to the river, could
hardly be imagined; but there was one object in particular upon
which all their interest centred. In the middle of a broad bed of
sand near the stream, some men were already piling logs of wood
into a square mass, and pouring oil on them; fixing tall poles at the
sides, and hanging garlands of flowers and wreaths of leaves to
them. The pile was large, and would soon be completed for the
sacrifice.</p>

<p>Vyas Shastree rode to the spot, and inquired of the men&mdash;they
were Brahmun priests&mdash;for whom the preparations were being made.
They did not know, they said,&mdash;it was a state matter. When the
Sutee came there to die, she would be seen. Meanwhile she was at
Vishnu Pundit's house, and he might go and see her, and worship
her, as others were doing.</p>

<p>At Vishnu Pundit's house! The place to which he was going!
Certainly, then, he should see the woman, whoever she might be, that
was to be burned. "Had her husband died, then, last night?" he
asked. If he had, the Pundit's house must be impure, and he must
look elsewhere for lodgings.</p>

<p>"No; the Sutee was in pursuance of a vow," they said,&mdash;"not an
ordinary one, and an effigy would be burned with her."</p>

<p>The Shastree was puzzled, and rode on, musing much at the
strangeness of the act, and unable to account for it satisfactorily.
Such sacrifices, from such motives, were no doubt meritorious, but
they were uncommon.</p>

<p>He was not far distant now from their destination, and, joining
Anunda, who, riding a stout ambling pony, was forcing her way
through the crowd, followed by the litter in which sat Radha, he
bade her come on leisurely, and himself urged his horse forward as
quickly as the crowded streets would allow, to his friend's house.
Vishnu Pundit himself was standing at the door of the outer court<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span>
opening into the street, across which some men were tying garlands
of green leaves and flowers. Seeing the Shastree advancing, he
came to him, and, assisting him to dismount, embraced him warmly.</p>

<p>"I received your note," he said; "but I have had no time to reply
to it. I have no room for you, old friend, owing to the Sutee whom
the Maharaja has sent to me&mdash;that is, not till to-morrow; but meanwhile
my neighbour the Josee gives you one of the courts of his house.
Take the ladies there," he added to an attendant, "as they arrive.
But do you, Vyas Shastree, come with me. I must speak with you
alone. Ah, we had mourned you dead&mdash;yet how wonderful it is that
you are here, and to-day, too! Come, I have much to say to you
that is strange&mdash;most strange."</p>

<p>The Shastree followed him curiously into an inner court&mdash;one like
that in his own house at Tooljapoor, where he taught his pupils.
Numbers of people were pressing through the outer court, bearing
offerings for worship; but in the place they went to, they were alone,
and the Pundit closed the door.</p>

<p>"Vyas Shastree," he said, looking at him intently as they sat down,
and speaking with irrepressible concern and grief in his voice, "O
friend! O dear old friend! I have dark news for thee to-day. Alas!
and woe to me that I have to tell it! Hast thou a daughter named
Tara?"</p>

<p>"I have come to seek her&mdash;followed her thus far&mdash;what of her?"
replied the Shastree, sickening with apprehension&mdash;"what of her?"</p>

<p>"She was a priestess of Toolja Máta at Tooljapoor, was she not?"
asked the Pundit.</p>

<p>"She was so, friend, and the Mussulmans carried her off. But
they spared her honour! O, say they spared her honour!" he exclaimed
piteously, and stretching forth his hands.</p>

<p>"She was an honoured guest with them, friend, and would that&mdash;&mdash;O,
how shall I say the rest?" he thought,&mdash;"how explain this misery?
Alas, what evil fate hath sent him to-day!"</p>

<p>"Thou art keeping something from me," said the Shastree, striving
to be calm. "If&mdash;if Tara&mdash;my daughter&mdash;&mdash;What is it, O friend?
we have suffered much suspense, much anxiety:&mdash;for her sake have
taken this weary journey; and we hoped to have found her here among
friends, perhaps with thee. What hast thou to say of her? Did
they not give her up, as we heard they would? Have&mdash;they&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, she is here," returned the Pundit hesitatingly, and turning
away his head in a vain attempt to repress his tears. "She&mdash;she&mdash;is
a widow, is she not?" he asked.</p>

<p>Then the truth flashed upon the wretched father with fearful
rapidity. That crowd of people; that hideous pile of logs: the
preparations and rejoicing were for her death&mdash;for Tara's, and after
all he was too late to save her! O, if he had only hurried on,&mdash;if he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span>
had only left home sooner! But thought now had no definite form.
It was a confused and conflicting chaos, utterly uncontrollable.
"Where have ye put her?" he asked, in a low husky voice, as, with
a sickening pressure at his heart, his features assumed the haggard
expression of weary age.</p>

<p>"Friend," said the Pundit, passing his arm around him and trying
to raise him up, "come and see. Such poor honour as we can do to
her on earth while she is with us, we have already done and will
continue. Come and see. Arise! If thou art a true Brahmun, hear
this, like a god on earth as thou art, and believe it for her eternal
glory. How few are chosen for this sacrifice! true jewels only are
they&mdash;pure gold, to be purified in the fire!"</p>

<p>"In the fire," he echoed dreamily&mdash;rising, and supporting himself
against a pillar in the room with a hopeless gesture of despair&mdash;"in
the fire!&mdash;I tell thee, Vishnu Pundit," he added presently, "it cannot
be: who has wrought this cruelty upon her? Who has done it? Of
her own act and will it could not have been; but if the council have
dared to&mdash;to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She thought you dead&mdash;you, her mother, and your new wife,"
replied the Pundit, interrupting him. "She was suffering hopeless
persecution and insult, and in the temple at Pertâbgurh she stood
before the Mother's image, and declared herself sutee before the
Brahmuns. Could we recall the words? I was present. Had it
been my own daughter I had been thankful. O Shastree! it was
her glory!"</p>

<p>Vyas Shastree could not reply. "Let me see her and hear it from
her own lips," was all he could utter at all intelligibly.</p>

<p>"Certainly, if thou wilt," replied the Pundit; "she is ready to go
even now, but the hour is not come. And yet, Vyas Shastree, beware;
would it not be better she believed you all dead, and so died happily
looking for you, than, seeing you alive, be shaken in her determination?
Will not the love of life come out of this, and rise defiant to
all convictions? Alas! alas! my friend, it is not for me to come
between your love and her mother's and that poor child; but beware!
she cannot retract now and live, otherwise than in dishonour and
infamy; and hereafter you will cry in agony to the goddess Mother,
she had better have died&mdash;and will be guilty of sin in having shaken
her faith if she live. Did you refuse when she was called before?&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The Shastree groaned, and his breath came as it were in broken
gasps. He was trembling violently. "I&mdash;I&mdash;must see her," he said.
"Let her decide;" and, unable to stand, he again sat down.</p>

<p>"Drink some water, Vyas Shastree; it will refresh you," said the
Pundit, bringing a vessel full from the end of the apartment.</p>

<p>"No, no, friend," he replied, putting it away, "I will not eat or
drink till this is past, if it is to be. Let us go. I am no less a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span>
Brahmun than thyself. If the Mother whom she serves has spoken
to her, it is well&mdash;she will go to her. My child! O my child!" cried
the miserable man in his agony. "O Mother, what hath she done
for this to come to her&mdash;she, so pure, to need the sacrifice of fire!
O Toolja Máta, was it needed? Come, Shastree, I am ready now,"
he continued, after a pause. "Do not delay."</p>

<p>The Pundit said nothing. He again passed his arm round his
friend to support him, and, leading him to a door in the further end
of the room, opened it. A small court intervened between the place
where they stood and a larger one beyond, the door of which was open,
and showed a crowd of people, mostly women, struggling to approach
some object beyond. All had garlands of flowers in their hands, and
vessels wherewith to pour libations. Suddenly there was a shrill
piercing scream; and the crowd swayed to and fro, retreating backwards
before some priests who were putting the people out.</p>

<p>"What can have happened?" cried the Pundit, hastening on.
"Come quickly."</p>

<p>Vyas Shastree felt instinctively that Anunda had seen Tara, and
he rapidly followed his friend. As he entered the next court, he saw
at a glance all he yearned for&mdash;all that he most dreaded to see.</p>

<p>A bower, as it were, of trelliswork, had been fitted up in the large
apartment of the Pundit's house which was raised slightly from the
ground, and it was covered with heavy garlands of green leaves and
flowers, as though for a bridal. In the narrow doorway of this bower
stood a slight female figure, richly dressed in a bright crimson silk
dress, striving to put away the arm of a Brahmun priest,&mdash;who was
preventing her from stepping forth,&mdash;and struggling with him. The
face was full of horror and misery, and the eyes flashing with excitement
and despair. Before her, without, lay an elderly woman
senseless on the ground, supported by a girl and several other women
who were weeping bitterly. Tara, Anunda, Radha!&mdash;how had they
met? Alone, he could have met Tara firmly, but with them? Not
now, however, did the Shastree's heart fail: no matter what followed,
honour or dishonour, he would not leave his child. Darting forward
past the Pundit, pushing aside some women, who, screaming senselessly,
would not be put out,&mdash;Vyas Shastree leaped upon the basement
of the room, and, dragging away the Brahmun priest, stood by
his child. "Tara, O my life! O my child!" he cried passionately,
"come forth, come to us!"</p>

<p>It was the effort of an instant only, for the attendant priests had
seized him and drawn him back forcibly, while they held him up.
"Thou canst not touch her now without defilement," one said, who
knew him. "She is sutee, O Vyas Shastree, and pure from thy
touch, even; she is bathed and dressed for the sacrifice."</p>

<p>"Tara, Tara!" gasped the unhappy man, not heeding the words.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span>
"Tara, come forth&mdash;come; I, thy father, call thee! O my child, do
not delay; come, we will go away&mdash;far away, to the Mother&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>To the Mother! Perhaps if he had not said this, Tara would have
been unable to repress those last fearful yearnings to life which now
tore her heart; but the echo fell on her own spirit heavily and irrepressively.
To the Mother! Yes, in her great misery, all she could
see in her mental agony&mdash;what she saw in the temple at Pertâbgurh,&mdash;all
that she had dwelt upon since,&mdash;were the glowing ruby eyes of
the Mother far away at Tooljapoor, glittering, as she thought, in glad
anticipation of her coming. The same Brahmun priest who was
preventing her egress when her mother appeared, had again crossed
his arms before the door. As she saw her father advance, Tara
staggered back affrighted; it was as though he had risen from the
dead; and at his despairing cry the girl could not have restrained
herself, had not the echo of his last words fallen on a heart which,
though wellnigh dead to life, had rallied for a while to its purest
affections;&mdash;but only for a while.</p>

<p>"Thou canst not move hence," said the Brahmun priest. "Cry
'Jey Toolja! Jey Kalee!' O Tara! thou wilt not now deny the
Mother!&mdash;all else is dead to thee."</p>

<p>No, she could not deny her now&mdash;she would not. With that
strange light in her eyes&mdash;that seemingly supernatural force in her
actions, which the people thought the emanation of divinity, Tara's
spirit was rallied by the priest's words. "Jey Toolja Máta!" she
cried, stretching her arms into the air; "I am true, O Mother! I am
true; and even these shall not keep me from thee now!"</p>

<p>Strange enthusiasm! stranger fortitude, which, having no terror
of a horrible death, has carried on its votaries even to the flames with
a constancy and devotion worthy of a nobler fate! In other cases
earthly love&mdash;the desire to free a beloved object from the pains of
suffering for life's errors, and insure final and perfect rest to its
immortal spirit&mdash;or a gratification of the all-absorbing grief which
looks on present death as the only remedy for despairing sorrow&mdash;might
exist; but here was no such incentive. The spiritual portion
of the girl's nature was alone concerned in the question; and that,
once excited by position and circumstance, had insured a more perfect
observance of her vow than earthly passion.</p>

<p>A strange enthusiasm indeed! Ah yes,&mdash;from the period to which
we can trace it in a dim legendary superstition of the past, through
the two thousand years since the Greek philosopher stood on the
banks of Indus and Ganges and recorded it, to the time when it was
made to cease under the stern power of a purer creed&mdash;how many
have died, alike self-devoted, alike calm, alike fearless! Women
with ordinary affections, ordinary habits of life, suddenly lifted up
into a sublimity of position,&mdash;even to death,&mdash;by an influence they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[478]</a></span>
were unable to repress or control&mdash;barbarous and superstitious if you
will, but sublime.</p>

<p>Tara had conquered. Her father hung upon her words with an
absorbing reverential fear, as the last sound of them died away and
was drowned in the shouts of "Jey Toolja Máta!" which burst from
the Brahmuns around, and were taken up by the people without,
whose frantic efforts to gain entrance were redoubled. He had
heard her doom from her own lips, and, believing in the inspiration
which prompted them, his head fell on his bosom; then the men,
feeling his frame relax, let him go, and he fell prostrate before his
child and worshipped her.</p>

<p>They had removed Anunda into an inner room, and her senses had
rallied under the care paid to her. As he rose with a despairing
gesture, and turned away from his child, the Shastree sought Anunda.
"There is no hope," he said, "wife&mdash;none. It is her own act, and
the Mother takes her. She is doomed, and I saw it in her eyes. It
is enough that we have come to see it; she is already gone far beyond
us, and we dare not recall her."</p>

<p>He closed the door, and within were Radha, Anunda, and himself.
What he said to them&mdash;how he consoled them, no one ever knew;
but after a while they came forth, bathed and purified themselves,
and went and sat silently near their daughter.</p>

<p>Now, they looked at her calm, glorious beauty as she sat within
the bower, decked for the sacrifice, with heavy wreaths of jessamine
flowers about her head, and rich golden ornaments about her person,&mdash;their
faith, cruel as it was, bid them rejoice. No more contumely
now, no more reproach, no more sin, no more persecution. Her little
history was told them by Vishnu Pundit, and believed. Tara was
pure, and if the Mother had called her&mdash;even through the fire&mdash;she
must go.</p>

<p>So they sat listening to her, as she recited those passages from the
Holy Books which her father loved, relative to humble and yet
glorious martyrs like herself,&mdash;men and women who had undergone
the trial, and were at last free. Sometimes she spoke to them calmly&mdash;told
them how she wished her ornaments to be disposed of&mdash;what
charitable donations were to be given in her name&mdash;what messages
were to be delivered to her friends, and the servants who had tended
her; but she never spoke of the past, nor alluded to her parents, as
though she had believed them dead. She never mentioned Afzool
Khan or his family; she shed no tear, nor did any human weakness
appear to mingle with the rapt devotion which it was evident filled
her mind, and absorbed every other faculty.</p>

<p>So they sat&mdash;the girl within, the father and mother and Radha
without, the bower&mdash;their eyes blinded by tears, their voices choked
with sobs. Tara bid them not to weep; but that emotion could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[479]</a></span>
be denied. No one dared to intrude upon that last terrible severing
of earthly ties. And so the priests chanted, and the shadows fell
eastwards, and lengthened.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_LXXXIV" id="CHAPTER_LXXXIV">CHAPTER LXXXIV.</a></h2>


<p>After a while, they heard the sound of drums and cymbals, and of
the rude Mahratta pipes, advancing up the street, playing a wailing,
mournful air, and the musicians stopped at the door of the outer
court. The people within fell back, and made a lane of egress, and
Tara rose and came forth from the bower. Once she prostrated herself
before her father and mother, and those with her saw a shiver&mdash;whether
of grief, despair, or terror, who could say&mdash;pass through her
body; but she recovered herself quickly, and as she stood on the
upper step of the basement, she asked for flowers, and, throwing
handfuls among the crowd, descended the steps into the court.</p>

<p>Then slowly on through the people, who worshipped her as she
passed; and out of the court into the street, where an open litter,
such a one as she had sat in when they made her a priestess of the
temple at Tooljapoor, awaited her. Carried in this, as in a triumphant
procession, and with baskets full of flowers before her, she
threw them among the crowd. As she proceeded through the streets,
shouts from the people around her, and from those on house-tops,
trees, and terraces, were redoubled; many women shrieked, and most
prayed aloud for the Sutee. The clash of the music increased, and
the march played was one of victory; while companies of Brahmuns,
bare-headed, joined the procession, singing and chanting the hymns
of death. So, on through the town, past the holy temples, and into
the river bed, where thousands awaited her, and set up a hoarse
shouting as they saw her first. What was the first honour of life as
a priestess, to this glory of its death?</p>

<p>She reached the pile, now covered with fluttering pennons, and
streamers,&mdash;orange, white, and crimson,&mdash;and thousands of garlands,
which the people had hung or thrown upon it as votive offerings since
the morning,&mdash;and the litter was set down for her to alight. It was
with difficulty the crowd was kept back so as to form a space round
the pile which would admit of her passing in procession; but it was
cleared at last by the Brahmuns, and the people hung back awestruck
and staring at the beauty of the victim.</p>

<p>Tara looked at the pile; but there was that strange ecstasy glowing
in her eyes which appeared to have rendered her unconscious of
its purport, or of all else about her. Sometimes she cast up her eyes
with a strange bright smile, and nodded as if she were saying, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span>
perhaps she did, "I come, I come." Again she looked round her
dreamily. The roar of the people's voices, the clash of cymbals, the
shrill screams of the pipes and horns, the hoarse braying of trumpets,
and the continuous beating of deep-toned drums, were around her,
drowning the sound of words, and the bitter sobs and low shrieks
of her mother and Radha at her side. Her father's spirit seemed
to have risen to the need of the occasion, for he stood near her
joining the solemn chant, which blended with, and softened, the rude
music.</p>

<p>As she stood, the Brahmuns worshipped her, and poured libations
before her and on her feet, touched her forehead with sacred colour,
and put fresh garlands over her neck. Then the last procession was
formed, in which she would walk round the pile thrice, and ascend
it, as her last act of ceremonial observance. Now, and before she
had to take off her ornaments, she turned her full gaze on it, and
they thought, who were watching her, that she seemed to comprehend
its purpose. A huge platform of logs, black with oil and grease
that had been poured upon them, strewed with camphor and frankincense,
which had been scattered lavishly by the people in their
votive offerings, and smeared with red powder. A rude step had
been made for Tara to ascend by, and on the summit some bright
cloths were laid as a bed, where she might recline, upon which a
small effigy of a man, rudely conceived and dressed, had been placed.
Her marriage-bed in the spiritual sense of the sacrifice, on which,
through fire, she would be united to her husband. The whole was
garish, hideous, and cruel. Face to face with death so horrible, so
imminent, the girl seemed to shiver and gasp suddenly, and sank
down swooning.</p>

<p>Vishnu Pundit, and another old Brahmun, raised her up. "It
must not be," they said to each other in a whisper; "she must not
fail now, else shame will come upon us."</p>

<p>Moro Trimmul was near her also, and had been one to seize her
mechanically as she was falling. To him the scene was like some
mocking phantasy, which held him enthralled, while it urged him to
action. Since he had murdered Gunga, his evil spirit had known no
rest; no sleep had come to him, except in snatches more horrible than
the reality of waking. Again and again he had felt the rush of the
girl's warm blood upon his hands, and the senseless body falling from
his arms into the black void of air, to be no more seen or heard of&mdash;and
had started up in abject fear. Day or night, it was the same;&mdash;the
short struggle, the frantic efforts of the girl for life, his own
maddened exertions to destroy her, were being acted over and over
again. Every moment of his life was full of them; and nothing else,
do what he might, go where he would, came instead. He had eaten
opium in large quantities, but it only made the reality of this hideous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[481]</a></span>
vision more palpable, and exaggerated all its details. He had busied
himself deeply in the arrangements consequent upon the victory and
the distribution of plunder, but with no effect. Haunted by Gunga's
murder on the one hand, by Tara's determination to die as Sutee on
the other, the remonstrances of Maloosray and other friends only
irritated him the more. They had endeavoured to restrain him from
going to Wye to see her burned, but with no result&mdash;he had broken
from them, and ridden over alone that morning.</p>

<p>Soon after he arrived, he heard that Vyas Shastree and his sister
were already there, and he had sought her, and in his former desperate
manner, threatened and persuaded in turn. It might be that, having
experience of these threats, Radha no longer feared them, or that the
position she now occupied was so utterly hopeless as regarded Tara,
that even he must see that it was useless to persecute her further.
As a last resource, he had proposed to some of his own men, desperate
and licentious as himself, to attack the procession, and carry
Tara away; but, hardened as they were, the sacrilege of violently
abducting a Sutee, was an impossible crime against their faith, and
his proposal had been rejected.</p>

<p>He was there, therefore, alone. He had bathed and performed the
needful ceremonies with the other Brahmuns, and the thought that
he should at least see Tara die, came, for the time, like sweet revenge
into his heart, feeding his evil passions and sustaining them. Devils
both, Tara and Gunga, witches and sorceresses. What matter if both
died horrible deaths? it was the penalty of their crimes; and in such
thoughts a momentary consolation was offered by the mocking fiend
at his heart, to be whirled away to the chaos of despair, in which
Gunga seemed writhing in her blood, and Tara tossing her arms in
the agony of the fire.</p>

<p>Thus he had walked with her, almost beside her, from the house,
through the streets, to the pile by the river-side. In the litter,
surrounded by chanting priests, she was unapproachable; but, sinking
to the earth helpless before him, she seemed once more fated to
be his prey.</p>

<p>"Tara, Tara," he whispered quickly and sharply in her ear, as,
helping her to rise, he passed his arm under her. "Come, O
beloved! save thyself, even now&mdash;even now. I can do it. Come,
O beloved!"</p>

<p>The words and his hot breath on her cheek roused the girl more
completely than aught else could have done. She did not speak,
but she arose, strong and defiant, and, shaking him off, pushed him
away so violently from her, that he staggered and fell backwards.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>For some time past, a body of horsemen, with their faces tied up,
after the fashion of Mahratta cavaliers, the housings of their horses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[482]</a></span>
weather-stained, and their arms rusty and unpolished, had moved
about the bed of the river and the bank beyond, and as the procession
advanced to the pile, pressed on nearer to the crowd. It might
be a hundred men or more; and the leader, who was a Mahratta,
spoke cheerfully to the people who addressed him, and told them
of his pursuit of the Mussulmans, and the raid they had done into
the Beejapoor country, from which they were only now returning in
time to see the show before they went home to the fort.</p>

<p>Our old friend Bulwunt Rao had become spokesman and
ostensible leader; and the hunchback rode with him, and bandied
words with the bystanders freely, but in good humour. With them,
too, was Fazil Khan, who joined heartily in the rough jokes which
were passing&mdash;many, at his own expense of ragged clothes, rusty
arms, and gaunt features: and thus the band pressed on to the very
skirts of the crowd, as if to see the Sutee, but actually to take up
the position necessary for their adventure. During the day they
had passed several bodies of Mahratta horse, but had been taken
for a similar party, and had as yet been unchallenged; and in the
crowd, their bold confident demeanour, and the ready replies given
to all questions, with the certainty among the people that every Moslem
soldier had perished at Pertâbgurh, or was a prisoner, prevented
any suspicion of their real character.</p>

<p>Bulwunt Rao had seen Sutee rites before. They had watched
the procession issue from the town, and he knew Tara would alight
from the litter when she arrived at the pile. As she did so&mdash;as the
litter was carried aside, and before the procession around the pile
was formed&mdash;they had determined to ride in upon the crowd and
bear her away. They had no fear of the result; there was not a doubt
among them. They knew that every horseman in the town would
be present there, unarmed and on foot, and that miles would be
passed by them ere pursuit could be made. Their old hiding-place
was not known, and beyond was open country; and if a long ride
by night, what fear?&mdash;the horses were fresh and well fed.</p>

<p>"Be ready, Meah," said Bulwunt Rao, in a low voice. "See, they
are clearing a space around the pile for her to walk. Holy Krishna!
how beautiful she is! 'Jey Kalee! Jey Toolja Máta!'" he shouted
with the crowd. Then turning to the hunchback, he bade him go
round the rear of the party and see they all kept together. "As one
man, Lukshmun, when they hear our shout, let them follow."</p>

<p>So they advanced nearer and nearer, and the crowd on foot,
unable to resist the pressure of the horses, gave way before them.
The sword of every man was loosened in its sheath, and a few of
the rear men, who had matchlocks with lighted matches slung over
their backs, unslung them, and held them on their saddlebows ready
for use. If any one had noticed Fazil Khan, they would have seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[483]</a></span>
him smoothing a cushion, as it were, of cloths upon the pommel of
his saddle, while he wakened his horse with an occasional touch of
his leg, and kept him excited for a sudden rush.</p>

<p>He moved up close to Bulwunt Rao. "If I fall, dear friend, in
this," he said, "tell them how it was, and take the men to them. Do
not wait for me; let them do with me as they list."</p>

<p>Bulwunt Rao smiled. "Fear not, Meah," he replied. "Ride
thou in to her, and trust to us for the rest."</p>

<p>Fazil's teeth were hard set, and his heart throbbed quick; but he
was calm and cool. It was no time for chance work, and there
must not be any mistake now. He felt his sword was loose in the
sheath, and smiled to himself. The men had orders not to strike
unarmed people; but if any resisted, there would be some revenge
for Pertâbgurh he thought, and, looking round, saw the rough faces
of his followers in thick array behind him, holding in their horses
as though for a race.</p>

<p>They saw Tara alight. Fazil was not a stone's-throw distant, and
perhaps she might see him, but she did not. He was not in her
thoughts now; the agony of relinquishing him had passed from her
in the despair of life long ago. They saw her suddenly sink down,
and Vishnu Pundit and Moro Trimmul stoop to raise her up.</p>

<p>"Bismilla! Futteh-i-nubbee!" cried the young Khan, as, pressing
his horse's flanks, the animal bounded forward. "Bismilla, brothers,
Ya Alla! Ya Alla!"</p>

<p>"Ya Alla! Ya Alla!" shouted the rest behind, as they too gave
their horses the rein, and all dashed forward furiously.</p>

<p>Some men with poles and sticks struck at Fazil, Bulwunt, and
Lukshmun, as they came on first, but none there had arms. It was
as Tara, watching the effect of her effort against Moro Trimmul,
stood apart, with flashing eyes and heaving bosom&mdash;belonging for
the moment to the world she had abjured&mdash;that the hoarse shout of
the horsemen fell upon her ear. She looked at them for a moment;
she saw people go down before them, trampled, shrieking, under foot,
and the weapons flashing in the sunlight. Then two men stopped
for an instant&mdash;she was between them: both stooped towards her
at the same moment, and one threw himself off his horse, and lifted
her to the other's saddle.</p>

<p>As it was done, a man sprang at Fazil's horse's bridle, with a
frantic execration, caught it, and jerked it violently. The noble
beast, urged on&mdash;for Fazil saw the danger&mdash;partly reared, but was
held down by the bridle; else it had fared ill perhaps with the
young man&mdash;for Tara was not sensible now, and he could only hold
her up with difficulty&mdash;had not Lukshmun been nigh.</p>

<p>"I never kill Brahmuns," he said through his teeth, "but thou
art a devil;" and he struck at Moro Trimmul's bare neck with all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[484]</a></span>
his force. As the wretched man sank to the earth under the terrible
wound, the hunchback sprang to his horse, clambered upon it like a
cat, and flourishing his bloody sword, though he struck no one, rode
by Fazil's side onwards, unharmed.</p>

<p>No one opposed them; the action was too sudden and too desperate.
The crowd, also, was not so thick towards the river, and gave
way before them; and, dashing through the shallow ford, the horses
throwing up the bright water in a cloud of sparkling drops, they
galloped up the bank, and even then, were beyond pursuit. A few
of the matchlock-men, firing their pieces over the heads of the crowd
beyond, shook them in defiance, as they turned to ride after their
party; and a few shots in return, the balls of which sang shrilly in
the air over their heads, were fired after them by people in the
throng with harmless effect.</p>

<p>It was long ere the party drew rein, and no one spoke. Tara lay
easily, supported on the cushion by Fazil's arms, and he watched
anxiously for signs of returning consciousness. It came at last, as
he felt her cling to him, and she looked up to his face, as they crossed
a small streamlet leisurely, with a pleading look which could not be
mistaken.</p>

<p>"Ah, fear not," he said; "fear not, beloved! Thou art safe now;
and that hideous pageant is far behind. Didst thou think, Tara, I
would leave thee to die that frightful death without an effort?"</p>

<p>The beauteous eyes opened again, and closed softly as the tears
welled from them. The rapt glittering expression of religious enthusiasm
had passed away, and left the world coming back fast into
them, with all its tender interests and love, a thousandfold more
powerful than before.</p>

<p>That night, another pile was lighted by the river-side, and a
corpse, never removed from the spot where it fell, was burned upon
it; but the pile of the Sutee remained, grim and black, and the
garlands of flowers had withered in the next day's sun ere it was
dismantled.</p>

<p>There were a thousand rumours current in the town for some days
as to who could have done so bold a deed, but no one guessed the
truth. Had Moro Trimmul lived, he could have told; but he had
never spoken after the hunchback's sturdy death-blow. So the
people believed that some of the starving Beejapoor cavalry, wandering
about, had determined to attack the people collected for the
Sutee, and plunder them of what they could; and that the rich
ornaments which the Sutee herself had worn attracted their attention,
and they had carried her off for them.</p>

<p>Some days afterwards, too, near a spot where the fugitives had
rested for a while, the remains of a young woman, so much torn by
wild beasts as to be unrecognizable, with some shreds of silken garments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[485]</a></span>
about them, were found by the village people. It was clear
that a murder had been done, and the circumstances under which
Tara had disappeared, rendered it probable that these remains were
hers. So they were taken into Wye: and the miserable parents,
believing them to be their daughter's, had them burned by the river-side
in all honour and respect, and thenceforth believed her dead.
They did not leave Wye immediately. The excitement and fatigue
had exhausted the Shastree, who required rest; and the ceremonies
consequent on Tara's death, and necessary purification, occupied
some days; so Vishnu Pundit's persuasions prevailed, and they
remained with him.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_LXXXV" id="CHAPTER_LXXXV">CHAPTER LXXXV.</a></h2>


<p>Khundojee Kakrey performed his promise faithfully. By secret
mountain paths known to few, and through the dense forests of the
tract which lies between Pertâbgurh and Kurrar, on the right bank
of the Krishna, the Mahratta guided his charge safely, and with as
much comfort as the nature of the journey would admit of. The
two women maintained their disguise of peasants, and Zyna's ability
to speak Mahratta, as well as Lurlee's to speak Canarese, assisted in
aiding the deception. By night Kakrey sought shelter of villages
where he seemed to be well known, for a decent house was always
ready for them to sleep in, the best delicacies of country farmhouses
cooked for them: and frequently, not only the matron of the house,
but other women of the village, attended to bathe them, and otherwise
minister to their comfort.</p>

<p>But for all this, those days were remembered as a time of bitter
grief and sore trial; the more difficult for Zyna to endure, because
Lurlee could not be brought to believe that her husband was dead,
and preserved throughout, a demeanour of hope, if not, indeed, of
actual joy. "No one saw him die," she would say, "his body was
not buried by them. They dare not say he is dead, and I will hear
no more of it. When we are at Kurrar he will return, and we will go
home together." Again and again, too, were the astrological diagrams
consulted: but the lady was unable to find any error in them,
and for the present they were to her far more conclusive than the
report she had heard from Fazil, and it was a happy thing for her,
perhaps, that the delusion lasted even as far as the town to which
they were journeying.</p>

<p>With Zyna, however, there was no delusion. She had at once
believed her brother's report. Kakrey, too, had told her that there
was no hope of her father's existence. Of Tara's fate he knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[486]</a></span>
nothing. Mourning for him, therefore, and in miserable anxiety
about her brother, Zyna had had to endure a twofold trial, which
her naturally buoyant disposition and innate piety only, enabled her
to sustain. Possibly, too, had she remained in one place it would
have been more severe; but the daily movement&mdash;in a manner
before unexperienced by her&mdash;the sense of freedom from restraint in
the wild country they traversed, the beautiful and, to her, wonderful
mountains, forests, and natural objects of all kinds, which,
brought up as she had been in the seclusion of a zenana, she had had
no chance of seeing before&mdash;served to divert her mind from the
terrible reality of her loss, to fill it with hope, and to render the sense
of danger they incurred in their escape to be blunted by the excitement
of perpetual change.</p>

<p>Of the servants who had escaped with them, and who joined
Fazil's party, Goolab alone remained to attend the ladies by permission
of their guide. She had been divested of every particle of
Mahomedan attire, and, dressed in a coarse Mahratta saree, with a
dab of red colour smeared on her forehead, and mounted upon a
small ambling bullock, passed readily for a Mahratta farmer's wife.
In this ride, the old woman was in her element; now guiding the
docile animal she rode, beside Lurlee, now beside Zyna, cheering
them on when they were fatigued, and often dismounting and supporting
them in places where the ponies hesitated and had to be
carefully led. Unless near a mountain village, their guide, Kakrey,
seldom approached them; he was generally in advance with some
of his men, while others remained behind, guarding the rear. When
in motion, the party was made to resemble, as far as possible, the
appearance of people journeying upon a pilgrimage, and small orange
flags, carried by several of the men, and fastened to the pommels
of the women's saddles, assisted and maintained the deception.</p>

<p>It was on the afternoon of the fourth day that, emerging from a
rugged pass in the mountains, they saw below them part of the wide
plain of the Dekhan, the blue waters of the Krishna river sparkling
in the sun, and the town, which they had hitherto only hoped to
reach. Great numbers of white tents were pitched upon the plain
near the fort, showing the presence of a considerable force, and the
royal standard fluttered lazily in the evening breeze from its highest
tower. It was a pleasant scene of quiet soft beauty, and seemed a
true resting-place for the now weary and almost exhausted travellers.
The last march had been a longer one than usual; for some of the
way they had passed through village lands, in regard to the people
of which Kakrey was not without apprehension; the country was
becoming more open, and the danger of detection greater; nevertheless,
he had guided them safely and truly, as he had promised.</p>

<p>It had been no easy matter to sustain the lady Lurlee that afternoon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[487]</a></span>
All the confidence she had displayed hitherto, false as it was,
seemed to have suddenly deserted her as she drew nigh to her destination;
and while they rested during the hottest part of the day,
under some cool shade by the side of a rivulet, Zyna saw that the
old diagrams were laid aside for once with a heavy sigh, and seemed
to afford no comfort. She thought the evident weariness might be
the result of a longer and rougher ride than usual, and tried to
soothe Lurlee. "Only a few coss more, mother," she said, "and we
are safe with our own people: do not fail now, when the end is so
near!"</p>

<p>"It matters not&mdash;what is the use of it?" replied Lurlee&mdash;"who
will care for us, now they are gone from us?"</p>

<p>"The Blessed Alla, and the Prophet, and the saints," answered
Zyna devoutly, "and there is Fazil too&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He could not love me, now that Tara is not with me," returned
Lurlee, interrupting Zyna.</p>

<p>"Tara, mother?"</p>

<p>"Yes, his soul will be gone away to her and to his father, Zyna.
He is dead," replied Lurlee, sighing. "I know it now. All day long
the old man's face has been before me, gashed and bloody, and I
think," she said, passing her hand across her eyes, "that I am not
deceived now&mdash;no, not now."</p>

<p>"We shall know the best or worst soon, mother; but Fazil could
not have been deceived," replied Zyna.</p>

<p>"And thou hast not wept, Zyna! O hard heart! Was he nothing
to thee? It is the old who cannot weep&mdash;the old like me."</p>

<p>Zyna's tears were falling fast, but she checked them. "I would
not grieve thee, mother, needlessly," she said; "when Fazil comes,
he will tell us all."</p>

<p>"If I could see her, the daughter the good Alla gave me, Zyna&mdash;the
girl who softened my heart&mdash;and give her to him&mdash;it would be
enough! but they took her away, and she, too, is dead! Once," she
continued mysteriously, after a pause, and catching Zyna's arm,&mdash;"once
since we were out in these wilds, she came to me in a dream,
and mocked me. She said she was going to die, and go to her
Mother, but she would come to see me first. Ah, she was very
beautiful, Zyna, and smiled lovingly upon me in her old way. Now,
when she said that, it must have been near morning, when we were
asleep in the village where they gave us milk to drink, and about
the third watch of the night; but I cannot understand what planet
ruled the hour. Ah me! I used once to do so, but the more I look
at the tables now, the more I fail."</p>

<p>"Trust in Alla, mother, not in them," replied Zyna.</p>

<p>"I have no trust in them," muttered Lurlee gloomily&mdash;"none now
in anything; all have failed me, and she most of all. O Tara! why<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[488]</a></span>
didst thou go? O my child, my child, whom Alla gave me when I
had none, and when thy mother died. Alas! why was I mocked,
Zyna? why did Alla take him too, who loved me, and leave me
here? O daughter, this is unjust oppression, this&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush, mother! else Alla will hear thee, and be angry, and the
saints too; and can any one resist fate? O mother, be patient!" said
Zyna soothingly. "Only for their help we had not escaped the
slaughter, and worse&mdash;dishonour; and yet we are here, and our
friends now are not far off."</p>

<p>"Your friends and Fazil's, girl!" she returned tartly. "I have
been of small account enough already among ye, and am not likely
to improve."</p>

<p>"Do not speak bitter words, mother, I beseech you," cried Zyna
entreatingly. "We are your children&mdash;indeed we are, and will
never leave you. If Fazil lives&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Peace!" rejoined the lady, interrupting her, "do not let falsehood
come into thy mouth, girl. Enough for me that Tara is not, and
thou art."</p>

<p>Zyna could never reply to Lurlee's caustic speeches, least of all
under the pressure of their mutual bereavement; and as they sat
there they broke forth from time to time from her without tear or
sob&mdash;old grievances&mdash;old jealousies&mdash;old allegations of neglect.
Matters which Zyna had utterly forgotten, seemed to have rushed
back on the lady's memory like a flood. They were hard to endure;
and yet not so hard, Zyna thought, as the false confidence, the fearful
mockery of truth and reality, which had lasted till then&mdash;that
disbelief in her father's death for which she could not account.</p>

<p>"Ah, if Tara can only be rescued from them, there may be some
natural revulsion yet," thought the girl; and yet what hope of that?
She could not deceive herself into a belief that Tara would be given
up, or that she could escape from her family; perhaps, on second
thoughts, she would not desire it&mdash;but if it could be so? And
amidst such conflicting thoughts, and the endurance of Lurlee's
dogged, desperate state of mind, the afternoon's journey into Kurrar,
though the last, was indescribably more miserable than any which
had preceded it.</p>

<p>They descended the pass, and were once more on level ground.
"Hence to Beejapoor," said Goolab cheerily, as she was leading
Lurlee's pony down the last steep descent, "there are no mountains&mdash;a
child might ride thither without trouble. Keep a good heart,
therefore, O my Khánum! trust in Alla, and the Prophet, and the
blessed Peer Khaderi, and thou wilt see it. I vow Fatehas to the
shrine, and to feed&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"They are liars like thyself," retorted Lurlee savagely: "peace,
for a prating old fool as thou art! Did not the planets tell me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[489]</a></span>
Afzool Khan was alive, and now men say he is dead! After that,
can I believe? O woman, thou art mad&mdash;so keep thy tongue silent!"</p>

<p>Goolab thought her mistress mad&mdash;perhaps she was so in some
degree. Excitement, grief as yet without vent, and heavy fatigue in
a blazing sun to one unaccustomed to exposure, might easily cause
temporary delirium, and it was with difficulty that she supported her
mistress upon her pony over the ground which intervened from the
bottom of the pass to the town. Shiverings had come on, and it was
evident that the poor lady might be seriously indisposed.</p>

<p>Several of Kakrey's Mahratta foot-soldiers, who had guarded them,
had run on to secure a lodging of some kind, and the travellers were
met at the town gate by one who had returned to wait for the
approaching party, and he guided them on. Other parties had
reached the camp from the fatal field, and more were still coming in
daily, so that the arrival of the travellers was unnoticed, and from
their disguise their persons and rank were quite unknown. To those
who saw them pass, they appeared women of the country who had
made a long journey that day, and were utterly wearied; for Lurlee,
closely muffled, was supported by Goolab, who walked by her side,
with her arm thrown round her waist; and Zyna, even more entirely
concealed from observation, leaned forward, supporting herself on her
arm, as if hardly able to maintain her place on the saddle. Kakrey
and his followers had closed round them so as to protect them from
the jostling of the people in the narrow street and crowded bazar of
the town, and all cheered the ladies by the assurance that the house
secured for the night was a good one, which belonged to a respectable
Mahomedan merchant, who had given part of it without hesitation
on hearing for whom it was needed. It is doubtful, indeed,
whether either of them could have supported their fatigue much
longer.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>A few steps further on, and Kakrey turned the ponies into a side
street, and stopped at the handsome gateway of a respectable house.
The steps up to the entrance being easy, the active mountain animals
scrambled up them in turn, and their riders were thus taken at once
into the first court. Then, when the gates were closed, Goolab lifted
them from their seats; and the men, who had remained without, took
possession of the guard-room inside the first archway, which, while
it afforded ample accommodation, enabled them to continue their protection
to the last.</p>

led Lurlee into the second court, they were met by a lady of middle
age, who, attended by several servants, advanced and saluted them
cordially, yet with a peculiar reverence.</p>

<p>"The wife and daughter of Afzool Khan are welcome to our poor
house. O lady! why did you not advise me of your coming?"</p>

<p>"Who art thou?" asked Lurlee faintly, "and who told thee of us?"</p>

<p>"My husband was at his office in the bazar," replied the lady, "and
some men came asking for shelter for noble travellers who were very
weary. He asked who they were, and was told of you. O lady, your
steps are fortunate, and Alla hath led you here to do us honour.
Many benefits hath my lord received from the noble Khan, and there
is much to repay&mdash;very much."</p>

<p>"Have you hot water for a bath, lady?" cried Goolab, interrupting
her, "and some decent clothes instead of these, and some food
that noble ladies can eat? They will be better than fine words.
Alas! that for the last four days we have eaten dry parched pease,
dry bread, garlic, and porridge&mdash;unblessed food, O lady; and my
mistress, you see, is ill of it, and talking to her won't cure her!"</p>

<p>"Fear not," replied the dame, smiling; "we have had scant notice,
yet we may do something," and she was as good as her word. Hot
water to bathe with, was quickly prepared, and clean refreshing
clothes; and the rubbings and kneadings of several young girls
relieved their weary aching limbs. Soft cushions were put down to
lie on; and there was a hospitable, grateful hostess ministering to
every want. Even Lurlee's churlish humour was already softened
by the attention paid to her; and she remembered, with satisfaction,
in spite of her late disbelief, that the day was Thursday, and that, as
she entered the house between five and six in the afternoon, the hour
was ruled by Mercury, and was propitious.</p>

<p>About the same time, a body of horsemen&mdash;there might have been
from two to three hundred of them&mdash;were approaching the town from
the other side, through the camp which spread out irregularly among
the fields and gardens. Their horses neighed frequently as they
passed tents where others were picketed, seemingly envious of their
rest and comfort; and the appearance of the whole party, jaded and
wayworn, indicated a long weary march in a hot sun that day, which
had now come to a close.</p>

<p>As they passed the first tents, the men loitering by the wayside
asked carelessly who they were, and being told, followed them
eagerly; while the news that one remnant of the noble host which
had been so treacherously destroyed at Purtâbgurh had arrived,
traversed the camp before them. As men of the Paigah of Afzool<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[491]</a></span>
Khan were recognized, many a rough heart swelled, many an eye
filled with tears, as the horsemen proceeded: while crowds followed
them, greeting old friends who had escaped, or tendering their
respectful salutations to the young Khan, and congratulating him on
his escape.</p>

<p>Bulwunt Rao and the hunchback were in front, and as they neared
the town urged their horses on. "Wait for us at the gate; we will
not be long, and will bring the water," cried the latter; and when
Fazil reached it, a litter&mdash;which had been rudely constructed of a
bed-frame and stout bamboo poles, covered with some coarse sheets&mdash;by
which he had been riding, was set down. The men who had
carried it were exhausted, and as they placed it on the ground, lay
down themselves at a little distance.</p>

<p>Fazil dismounted and approached it. "Tara!" he said, "Tara!
art thou asleep? We have arrived, and there is now no more fatigue
or danger. O Tara, awake!"</p>

<p>The girl turned mechanically towards him, but did not seem to
recognize him; her eyes were much glazed, and her lips cracked and
parched. "Water," she said faintly.</p>

<p>"Alas! I dare not give it thee, Tara," he replied. "O my life&mdash;O
beloved, look up! wait but till they return, and all will be well!"</p>

<p>She shook her head, and a smile, very sad and sweet, seemed to
pass over her face, but she did not speak. Fazil looked out among
the people passing to and fro; perhaps there might be a Brahmun
among them, who could give her a few drops of water to moisten her
mouth, but he saw none. How wearily the time seemed to pass!
With what impatience did he watch the gate whence Lukshmun or
Bulwunt Rao, on their double errand, should return; and with what
misery did he look upon the poor girl, lying in heavy fever, without
the means of relieving her! How he longed for his sister or Lurlee!
but it might be days ere they arrived, and till then he must trust her
to strangers.</p>

<p>It had been a weary day, indeed&mdash;a day of intense anxiety to all
who accompanied him. Under the excitement of release from
imminent death, and in the rapid ride of the afternoon of her
rescue, Tara had borne the fatigue wonderfully; and as night set in,
and they took some hurried rest among the corn-fields of a village,
Fazil hoped that she would sleep, and be refreshed against the morrow;
but it was not to be so. During the night the girl began to
speak incoherently at times, and it was evident that she suffered
from high fever. Still they must proceed; there was no delaying
there. The tracks of his party were distinct, and a force of the
enemy's horse might yet overtake them and destroy them if they
tarried.</p>

<p>So, after feeding their horses on green corn-stalks, and themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[492]</a></span>
obtaining a rough meal from the green heads of corn roasted in a
fire, they again set forth. They had no other food, for they dare
not stay to cook it, and they had avoided villages as likely to expose
themselves to collision with the surly people. Once or twice, straggling
parties of cavalry had been met; but they had passed without
notice, and the farther they proceeded, the less chance there was of
interruption. So far all was well; but Tara grew worse, and could
no longer sit the horse on which she had been placed; so, in a village
which was passed, a litter was contrived, a drink of milk obtained,
and the party again set forward. Finally, they had arrived safely at
Kurrar; but Tara now knew no one, she could not be roused to
speak, and lay moaning piteously, as if in pain.</p>

<p>"When she gets water it will refresh her," thought Fazil, as he
sat helplessly by her, praying, in his own simple fashion, that God
would be good to him and spare her. "Weariness and the terror of
death have caused this," he said to himself, "and rest alone can
cure it."</p>

<p>At last Lukshmun returned with a Brahmun and some water, and
the man, looking into the litter, shook his head hopelessly.</p>

<p>"She is dying," he said; "let her be taken out and placed on the
ground, that her spirit may depart easily."</p>

<p>Fazil flung him away angrily. "She shall not die," he cried passionately;
"give her the water&mdash;as much as she will drink." But it
was of little avail,&mdash;she scarcely swallowed any, and motioned the
man away with her head impatiently.</p>

<p>Then came Bulwunt Rao. "I had much ado to find the merchant,"
he said, "and when I did, he told me strange guests were
already with him, and that he could not find room for a Brahmun
woman. Nevertheless he yielded at last, and we are to go. I rode
by the house. The porch was full of men, so we must seek shelter
elsewhere. The merchant said he would meet you at the door of the
house, but he does not yet know who you are. I did not tell him. I
only said you were a nobleman of Beejapoor."</p>

<p>"And why did you not tell him?" cried Fazil, with some impatience;
"he owed my father a thousand benefits."</p>

<p>"So much the better, Meah," returned Bulwunt, "and he looks as
though he would repay them. Come, it is close by."</p>

<p>The bearers again took up the litter and carried it on. Fazil
accompanied it on foot, holding the side; and at the same door which
we have already described, stood a pleasant-looking man, dressed in
flowing Arab robes and a green turban, and several servants behind
him,&mdash;who saluted Fazil courteously as he stood aside for the litter to
go by.</p>

<p>"Meer Jemal-oo-deen, if thou art he," said Fazil, "will have forgotten
one whom he knew long ago."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[493]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have forgotten your face," returned the man, "yet you are
welcome, and the peace of the Prophet be upon you. Who are you?"</p>

<p>"Fazil, the son of Afzool Khan," was the reply.</p>

<p>"O, great joy! O, thanks be to Alla!" cried the man, lifting up his
hands, "and blessed be the saints and the Prophet who have sent
thee. Embrace me, and come in quickly, for thy mother and sister
have also been brought to us, and are safe within."</p>

<p>"Then she will live! they will save her!" cried the young man
excitedly. "They will save her! O Meer Sahib, where are they?"</p>

<p>"Within, in the zenana," replied the merchant. "Sorely exhausted,
I hear, but already better; and she?" and he pointed to the litter.</p>

<p>"No matter, sir," said Fazil, advancing; "all will be told you
hereafter. She is much to them; but she is grievously shaken, and
we lose time. She cannot speak, and is burning with fever."</p>

<p>"Ah, is it so? Then let her be carried in," and he clapped his
hands. "Take that litter within at once," he said to the women who
came; "then see to the lady who is in it."</p>

<p>Four stout women took up the litter, carried it into the inner court,
and set it down.</p>

<p>Lurlee and Zyna were lying in an inner room, the door of which
was open, and from whence the entrance to the court could be seen.
"What can they be bringing in?" said Lurlee, as she saw the end of
the strange litter entering the door. "A man following, too! Begone!"
she screamed violently, hiding her face under the sheet;
"begone! this place is private."</p>

<p>"Mother," cried Fazil, who heard her voice but did not see her;
"it is I; and here is Tara. Come, O Zyna; where art thou? Come
quickly to her."</p>

<p>O delicious joy! Lurlee, forgetting all her previous troubles,
sprang from the bed on which she had been lying languidly, and
Zyna followed; and they fell upon his neck with low whimpering
cries, like dogs when they have found a lost master. Where was
fatigue now?</p>

<p>Tara! It was far in the night ere consciousness returned to her.
"No matter, Alla hath sent her again to us," said Goolab, whose
ideas were always of the most practical description; "she is ours
now, and we will bathe her." And some Brahmun women, who lived
hard by, came and assisted. So, ere morning broke, Tara was lying
on Lurlee's bosom sobbing gently: and, with her loving arms wound
round her recovered treasure, Zyna was sobbing too.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[494]</a></span></p>


<hr class="chap" />

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_LXXXVII" id="CHAPTER_LXXXVII">CHAPTER LXXXVII.</a></h2>


<p>Some three weeks after the events recorded in the last chapter, Zyna
and Lurlee were sitting near the foot of the bed on which Tara was
lying, and two Brahmun women&mdash;widows, as appeared from their
shaven heads and coarse serge garments&mdash;sat on each side of it.
One was fanning her gently. The bed was very low, hardly a foot
from the ground, so that the women were seated on the floor, leaning
against its frame. They had watched all night in pairs by turns,
and the dawn was just about to break; but a small lamp, in a niche
of the wall, threw a faint light over the room and the verandah beyond,
and fell upon a figure lying there, covered in a sheet, which appeared,
from its measured breathing, to be asleep. All four women were
weeping silently, and their faces had that worn, haggard expression
which is consequent upon long and continuous watching.</p>

<p>"When did he say he would come again?" asked Lurlee of one
of the women in a whisper.</p>

<p>"They will both be here at dawn," said the woman addressed;
"but they said they could do nothing now, unless she rallies of herself:
medicine cannot help her; and still she sleeps."</p>

<p>"Look," said Zyna, with a tone of awe in her low voice, "if you
can see her breathe. I have been watching for some time, and I
cannot see the sheet over her move as it used to do. Mother! mother!
she is not gone from us!"</p>

<p>"No, daughter," returned Lurlee, "she lives still, but she is near
to death, fearfully near, and is in the hands of Alla. If she wake up
restless, as she was before, we must put her on the floor, that the
spirit may pass easily; but, as it is, we may yet hope, for there is rest
now after her weariness, and she hath not asked for water all night.
You have given her none, have you?" she asked of the women.</p>

<p>"No, lady," replied the elder of the two; "none since she went to
sleep. It is near dawn, and if the soul had to pass it would be restless
to go; yet she sleeps. We cannot move her, nor is there need;
she breathes as gently as a child. Look!"</p>

<p>The woman took the lamp from the niche in the wall, and, shading
it with her hand, yet so as to suffer a little light to fall on Tara's
face, looked at it earnestly. "She smiles," she said in a whisper;
"behold, lady, but do not rise, else it might wake her."</p>

<p>Lurlee and Zyna leaned forward and regarded her anxiously.
Yes, the lips, though blistered with the parching heat of fever,
seemed fuller and redder, and, as the sweet mouth was partly open,
the light fell upon moisture on the white pearly teeth which glistened
brightly. The cheeks were not so wan and sunken, and the eyes,
instead of being partly open, with a dull glassy stare which, except<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[495]</a></span>
when they flashed in delirium, had been their only expression for
several days past, were now closed entirely, and the long eyelashes
rested peacefully, as it were, on the cheek. One hand had been
placed under her head, and the other lay across her bosom. Her
breathing could scarcely be seen, and yet, if they looked intently,
the arm across the bosom heaved slightly now and then, and as it
were without excitement.</p>

<p>"It may be the flush of life which precedes death," said the woman;
"yet then they do not often smile, nor dream. See, she is smiling
again."</p>

<p>"Ah, there is no death in that smile, daughter! Look! O blessed
saints, pray for her! O Prophet of God, she will be thy child soon;
intercede for her, and have her spared! O holy Syud Geesoo Duraz!
I vow a golden coverlet for thy tomb, and Fatehas to a thousand poor
mendicants, if she be saved!" cried Lurlee, with clasped hands and
streaming eyes. "O, give her to me! All have children but me,
and this one strange child I took into my heart when ye sent her,
and she abode there. O, take her not&mdash;take her not from me!
What use would she be to ye now in her young life? Wilt thou not
pray too, Zyna, for her?"</p>

<p>"Mother, I have prayed," replied Zyna earnestly. "Fazil hath
prayed. We have vowed Fatehas to all the shrines, and to the holy
Saint at Allund. Mother! I will send my gold anklets and her zone
to the shrine there, if she but live, and will give her others."</p>

<p>So they watched and prayed, and saw the smile playing gently and
sweetly over Tara's mouth and eyes. Was it to hear the whisper of
the Angel of Death? It might be so, and then the last dread change
would follow; the eyes would glaze and sink, the breathing become
shorter and more difficult, and they must take her up and lay her
down on the ground to die. Would it be so?</p>

<p>For many days Tara had lain between life and death. The great
excitement she had passed through&mdash;during which her mind, strung
by despair and superstitious belief, had sustained her&mdash;had passed
away suddenly, and left its never-failing result in the utter prostration
both of mental and physical power; and the exposure she had
been subjected to in that wild night-ride from Wye, with the succeeding
days of heat and fatigue, in the midst of constant alarm, had
combined to produce severe fever. As she was lifted from the litter
the evening she arrived by the women, she was entirely unconscious;
but in Lurlee she had at once a skilful and loving nurse, and after a
while she had recovered sufficiently to distinguish with whom she
was, and to feel that the hideous insecurity of her life&mdash;nay, the
imminent peril of a horrible and violent death&mdash;had passed away.</p>

<p>But after that short period of blissful recognition, and with the
sound of Lurlee and Zyna's passionately endearing welcomes in her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[496]</a></span>
ears, unconsciousness had returned, and she knew no more for many
days. The burning fever, accompanied by low delirium, continued
without intermission. Happily her mind retained its last pleasant impressions
most vividly: and from time to time, Lurlee and Zyna heard
her murmur to herself more of her deep love for Fazil than she would
ever have dared to tell them, and they listened wonderingly to the
strange mingling of his name with those of gods and demigods of
her own faith, and to the impassioned expressions which broke from
her in that wild, perhaps poetic, language, with which, from her own
studies and her father's recitals, she had become familiar.</p>

<p>The doctors of the town were early summoned; and there was an
old Gosai, known to the merchant's wife, who lived in a village
near, whose repute for curing cases of fever was very great, and who
was sent for, when the doctors' period of nine days' illness had elapsed
without any relief. He declared the fever would last three weeks:
and that, on the twenty-first day, or thereabouts, Tara would either
live or die, for the disease was dangerous and difficult to subdue,
but&mdash;he would do his best. So they sat and watched her day and
night; life now seemingly trembling on her lips, and yet again
rallying within her, and giving hope when otherwise there was none.</p>

<p>Now, too, under the long sleep, her features had relaxed; the skin
had lost its unnatural tension and dryness, and a soft smile was
there which looked like life; and still they prayed and made vows.</p>

<p>"No," said the woman, holding the lamp and watching Tara, "it
is not death, lady&mdash;not yet. There is no change; and see, the smile,
faint as it is, does not pass away. Surely there are sweet thoughts
below it&mdash;thoughts, perhaps, of life. Let us wait and pray."</p>

<p>And still they sat, and, after their own fashion, humbly prayed
too; and the morning broke, and Fazil, who, wearied by watching,
lay outside, arose, performed his ablutions, and, with Zyna, spread
their carpets, and performed the morning service. Then he watched
in turn; and the doctors came, looked at the sleeping girl, and one
of them gently put his hand on her pulse and felt it, and smiled, and
nodded his head approvingly. "There is life in it," he said gently,
"but it is very feeble. Wait till she wakes&mdash;that is the crisis of life
or of death; but, perhaps&mdash;God knows&mdash;it may be life."</p>

<p>It may be life! Ah, yes! Many who read these pages will
remember like scenes; watching the fluttering spirit of one most
beloved&mdash;parent, or wife, or child&mdash;with an intense and wondering
earnestness of misery or of hope, mingled with prayer: incoherent
perhaps&mdash;no matter&mdash;yet going straight from the heart, up to Him
in whose hands are the issues of life and of death, to be dealt with
as He pleased. Is there none of this among the people we write of?
Why not as much as among ourselves? The same motives exist
there as here, the same deep ties of affection, the same interests, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[497]</a></span>
the same hopes and fears&mdash;often, indeed, more powerful as belonging
to minds more impetuous, and less regulated by conventional forms.
Then the hope is greater, the agony of bereavement more bitter, and
the suspense between the final issue, perhaps, more unendurable.</p>

<p>So they sat around her. The kind, hospitable merchant's wife,
with whom they still resided, came forth from her own court of the
house, and, smiling as she saw Tara, bid them be of good cheer. No
one spoke afterwards, but they watched the tranquil face; and the
expressions still varying upon it, under the thoughts passing within,
gave increasing hope of life.</p>

<p>It had been a sore struggle; but life at last was suffered to triumph
over death. From the time when the weary tossing to and fro ceased,
and the parched lips refused to speak even incoherently, and the
deathlike sleep began, the exhausted frame had been gathering
strength. More than a night, and nearly a day, had passed in hope
and fear alternately to them, but in rest to Tara; and as the shadows
were falling long towards the east, the sweet eyes opened to the full,
and looked around.</p>

<p>They could see but dimly at first; but they read in the faces which
at once turned towards her, now the most precious on earth, the
assurance of that love, of which, as her spirit hovered on the threshold
of the unknown eternal land, she had been permitted to dream.
There was no fever now in those soft eyes&mdash;no glare, no glassy
brightness: but dewy, and their deep brown and violet shaded by
the long lashes, into an expression of dreamy languor&mdash;they seemed
more beautiful by far than they had ever appeared before, and Fazil
thought, as his creed suggested, that those of a Houri of the blessed
Paradise, or a Peri angel of the air, could not be more lovely. None
of them could speak then; but the tears were falling fast from their
eyes in great and irrepressible emotion, as they stretched forth their
arms to welcome Tara to life.</p>

<p>"My child! my life!" cried Lurlee, sobbing, who was the first to
find utterance. "Now, God hath given thee to me again, and I will
never leave thee&mdash;never. O, do not speak; it is enough that we see
thee come back to us, more precious, and more beloved than ever!"</p>

<p>Tara attempted to reply, but was too feeble. They saw her lips
moving, but no, words could be heard. She tried to stretch forth
her hand to Zyna, but she could not lift it. Zyna saw the attempt,
and threw her arm round her. "Not now, beloved," she said&mdash;"not
now. Lie still and rest; we are all near thee, and will not go away."</p>

<p>So more days passed, and Tara grew stronger, though slowly.
The shock to mind and body had been very heavy, and needed long
rest and much care; but she was in tender hands, and gradually, but
surely, they saw progression to convalescence, and were thankful.
Lurlee could not restrain her pious gratitude; and Friday after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[498]</a></span>
Friday, the poor of the town, Hindus as well as Mahomedans, received
a munificent dole of food and money, and rejoiced at the widow's profuse
charity.</p>

<p>Dear reader, if you have ever recovered from such an illness as
befell Tara, you will remember, vividly and gratefully, the pleasant
languor, the perfect rest, and the sensation of growing strength of
life,&mdash;amid its weakness, such as you cannot estimate till you attempt
to act for yourself. You long to speak, but your tongue refuses words;
you long to rise and help yourself, but your members as yet decline
office. If you can turn yourself about as you lie, it is all that is possible.
Then, if you are ministered to by loving hands, and you hear
sweet familiar voices around you, how often has your heart swelled,
and run over at your eyes, silently, and in very weakness, as you
have abandoned yourself to their sweet influences! How powerfully
the new life which God has given you, grows under their ever-present
care! Sometimes you can hardly bear the excess of joy, and
tremble lest it should suddenly cease; and again, you find periods
of rest possessing you&mdash;dreamy unrealities&mdash;incomplete perceptions&mdash;even
vacuity, which is not sleep, nor yet waking&mdash;and still with
all, a consciousness of increasing strength which will not be denied.</p>

<p>It was so with Tara. No one spoke much to her, she could not
bear it, nor could she reply; but if Zyna sat by her, or Lurlee, and
held her hand, it was enough for reality; and morning and evening
Fazil was admitted to see her, and to satisfy himself that she was
gaining ground. The past was never alluded to by any of them.
At first she had only a dim and broken remembrance of it, as of
some great ill-usage or suffering. As she grew stronger, the detail
became more distinct: and they often saw her shudder, and draw
the end of her garment or the coverlet over her face, as if to hide it
from observation, or to shut out some terrible sight from her view.
Yet to herself there was an unreality about the whole, which she
could neither comprehend, nor account for. Most of all about her
parents: were they indeed alive, or was their sudden appearance on
the day of the Sutee, a reality, or a trick of imagination&mdash;was all she
retained in her mind one of the hideous dreams of her illness rather
than a fact? Who was to tell her the truth?</p>

<p>All that Fazil had heard from the hunchback, he had told to Tara
as they rested here and there in their escape; but her own mind was
then in that state of terror and confusion that she could tell him
nothing, nor, indeed, could she find courage to speak to him at all.
Long before, when they had been together in camp, she had never
dared to answer him. It was enough for her that he spoke, and that
she listened. Her mind, as he rode with her that night before him&mdash;for
he would trust her to no one&mdash;was sorely unhinged. That she
had escaped death she knew; that she was with him she knew also:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[499]</a></span>
that she feared pursuit, and might be taken and burned alive, was an
absorbing terror, which shut out the shame of her flight; and it was
perhaps a happy circumstance that the fever, which had so long
affected her brain, shut out all realities till she was stronger, and
calmer to bear them.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_LXXXVIII" id="CHAPTER_LXXXVIII">CHAPTER LXXXVIII.</a></h2>


<p>Day by day, as strength returned to Tara, remembrance returned
also. It might have been with abhorrence of her present position&mdash;with
dread of her broken vows&mdash;with terror of the Mother's vengeance,
and with a sense of her own pollution as an escaped Sutee&mdash;which
would have utterly overwhelmed her with remorse, and forbidden
recovery at all; and in such a case, death would have been
welcome. We will not say that there was no revulsion of feeling: it
would have been unnatural in one with so fine an intellect as Tara
possessed, had there been no struggle. Perhaps the new life to
which she awakened, after the illness she had undergone, had blunted
the perceptions of the old; perhaps, as Zyna and Lurlee told her,
that it was her destiny, which she could not resist; and that, if she
were to have died, as her creed had determined, could Fazil have
prevented it?&mdash;would she have been delivered at all? Had she not
already undergone the pains of death in preparation for it, and been
delivered from them?</p>

<p>Then Lurlee again brought forth her books, and went over all her
old calculations, and there were the priest's also with them, all tending
to the same point. If her faith had been shaken for a time, in
the fact that Afzool Khan had died, when the planets showed that he
should be victorious, might there not have been some mistake? Here
at least there was none; none in the restoration of her child, as she
called Tara, from death to life&mdash;none in her having been rescued from
the evil idolaters and Kafirs, to be newly born into the true faith,
acceptable to Alla and the Prophet. All this was very plain and
incontrovertible.</p>

<p>Could Tara deny it? It was not clear that she even attempted to
do so: and ever nigh her, were anxious pleaders against any justification
of the rites of her own faith, from the most horrible consummation
of which, she could not possibly have escaped. "Even your
father and mother could not have saved you had they desired it,"
argued Zyna, "from dying in the fire before them: they would have
seen you burned, and shouted 'Jey Kalee!' with the rest, to drown
the scream of your dying agony; but they would not have relented."
No; Tara's heart told her they would not have relented, and she
must have perished, but for Fazil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[500]</a></span></p>

<p>And when he pleaded?&mdash;It was long before he attempted it; but
it was at last irrepressible. More than his sister and Lurlee, he knew
what struggle would ensue in Tara's heart if she were called upon
too suddenly to renounce her own faith; for he had lived, young as
he still was, more in the world. On this point, he had as yet forborne
to address her at all. But such love as his for the deserted girl, must
be spoken by himself. Lurlee and Zyna had told him all they had
said, and it seemed strange to both that he was silent; but he had
judged rightly. What the girl could bear from them, could not have
been endured from him till her bodily strength assisted her mind to
bear it, and he waited his opportunity.</p>

<p>It was the first time she had ever mentioned her own affairs;
almost the only time she had spoken freely at all. She had reverted
to the past, to the day of the attack on Tooljapoor, and to Fazil's
recovery of her mother's ornaments; for the Brahmun women had
bathed her that day, and she had performed some simple ceremonies
of her faith for purification after her illness, and charitable gifts had
been distributed by Fazil and Lurlee on her behalf. So she had
suffered Zyna to twist a garland of flowers into her hair as she used
to do in camp, and to put on her some of the old ornaments which,
while she was yet decked for the Sutee, had been brought away with
her: and when Fazil, who had been absent all day in the camp,
returned before sunset for the evening prayer, he found her talking
earnestly with his sister.</p>

<p>Still pale, but only showing the traces of illness in the purity of
her colour, Tara had perhaps never looked more lovely than in the
resumption of some of her former richness and elegance of costume;
and as Fazil entered the court, for the moment unobserved by her
and Zyna, who were seated together, he stopped involuntarily to
regard her.</p>

<p>Tara would have fled when they saw him, but Zyna would not
have it so.</p>

<p>"Look," she said, "brother, is she not like herself once more?
See how I have decked her for her sacrifice of thanks to-day! Surely
all that is past is as a dream, and Tara is again what she was the
evening she was taken away from us. Is she not, brother? She is
not changed?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "changed, I think, in spirit in her new life, as we
had hoped&mdash;that is all! Tara, sit down: we will all remain together,
and you must hear me now, with Zyna as witness.</p>

<p>"There is nothing new to say," he continued, after a pause&mdash;"nothing.
It is only the old tale, once told before, when you believed
it: and it is not changed, only confirmed. Ah! we have both been
tried since; and if out of that trial you have come, like me, strengthened,
then there is no doubt. Tara! in the deadly struggle by that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[501]</a></span>
hideous pile, with the crash of music, and frantic screams of the
people in your ears, even then your heart bore witness to me that I
was true. Am I false now?"</p>

<p>"O no, no, no!" cried the girl, throwing herself uncontrollably at
his feet, after her old Hindu fashion. "Not false, not false! You
are my lord and my saviour, and I worship you! I will be your slave,
your servant, for my life, and Zyna knows it; but consider&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not thus, beloved," he said, gravely but kindly stooping and
raising her up, "will I hear that, but so, face to face. There is no
shame in it now&mdash;none; for it is our destiny, Tara: let it be as
honoured as, methinks, it is loved. Sit there and listen." And
Zyna put her arm round her, and they sat down together side by side.</p>

<p>"I have to say hard words, perhaps, Tara," he continued, "but
you must hear them. In saving you from death by fire, I have
brought you into a living death from your own faith; for you are an
outcast now, as you know&mdash;you cannot return to it. You could not
be received as a Brahmun, nor would any other caste assist you.
Shaven, denied shelter, and even water, by the very mother who bore
you&mdash;if she live&mdash;you must herd with the vilest, and enter that condition
of abject dishonour and profligacy which Moro Trimmul intended
for you, and from which God&mdash;your God as well as mine, Tara&mdash;has
now delivered you. There is nothing else for you that I can see but
death, and that is now gone from you, and will not return. Could
you escape this, Tara? Is this a life for you?"</p>

<p>He saw the girl shudder violently, and bury her burning face in
Zyna's bosom; while Zyna, drawing her to herself more closely, said
gently, "Listen, listen; is he speaking the truth? You do not
answer, O beloved!"</p>

<p>Tara could not reply, but she clung to Zyna the more closely.</p>

<p>"Or instead," continued Fazil, "there is, what was said once before,
in presence of my honoured father&mdash;peace be with him!&mdash;which I
now repeat, and Alla and the Prophet, who sent me to you, and you
to me, are witness of its truth,&mdash;that all of honour, all of wealth, all
of love and respect that I possess, I will share with you as my wife,
till I die. You are not of us, nor of our creed: no matter, we can
admit you honourably to both. It is no disgrace to quit the blood-stained
belief of Hinduism to join the glorious ranks of the true
believers; but a blessed gain, for which, out of all these trials, Alla
hath preordained you. Enough, O Tara: before Him, your God
and mine, and before Zyna, answer to me truly and freely, once and
for ever. He is witness that there is no constraint upon you."</p>

<p>Could she resist that earnest manly pleading&mdash;she, already won
long ago? she who, in all her trial, had carried about in her heart
that image of glory and beauty, which she could only compare with
the heroes and demigods of her own sacred poems&mdash;her highest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[502]</a></span>
standard,&mdash;and who, in putting it away, had done so, only to die in
that horrible, calm despair, which preceded voluntary immolation?
It was impossible!</p>

<p>As she sat there, and as he ceased speaking, there rushed through
her mind a sudden flood of old memories which, had the love she bore
for him been weak, or less deeply rooted than it was, had swept it
away as the torrent sweeps dry straws from its bed, and they are
seen no more. Father, mother, Radha, the old pleasant memories of
Tooljapoor, and the old people; a happy childhood, a joyous budding
into womanhood without care. Next, her service to the goddess,
and all that had come of it&mdash;terror, desperation, and living death.
She could not serve her now, even did she desire it; and she could
not see the image as before, nor the weird ruby eyes which used to
follow her, and seemed to glint into her very heart. She remembered
the fierce Brahmun, her foe&mdash;the glittering fly which she had
seen in her little garden&mdash;and trembling, clung more closely to the
breast on which she was lying; and, last of all, the hideous pile of
black logs, the crash of gongs and drums, the shouts of the people,
the fluttering pennons, the torches blazing around her to light her to
death, and the agony of two women as they beheld it all, and of an
aged man who had come to her and caused her once more to fear&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>It takes long to write this; but all, ay more, rushed through the
girl's heart as a strong flood in a moment, tossing and whirling
fiercely: yet it shook nothing there. How true was it that, in that
long unconsciousness and delirium, the old life had passed away,
and the new one came with other obligations to be fulfilled. She
was weeping passionately while Fazil was speaking, but when the
rush of thought came, it was with awe, which repressed other
emotion, and was succeeded by calm, inexpressibly sweet and assuring.
Yes, love for him had resisted the fury of passion in its last
attempt, and she could not control it now. Zyna felt her arms withdrawn
from about her, and Tara, covering her burning face, on
which the tears were glistening, with her garment, bent down before
him, not in prostration, as before, but kneeling and bowing her head
reverently, as she joined her hands in an attitude of supplication.</p>

<p>"Do with me as thou wilt, my lord," she said gently; "my life
is thine, and I am thine henceforth till I die. I am helpless now&mdash;do
not forsake me; and God and Zyna are witness that I pledge my
troth to thee, freely and humbly. I have no fear&mdash;none! it is past
now!"</p>

<p>"Shabash! Shabash! Tara," cried Zyna exultingly, clapping her
hands; "now thou art ours indeed. See, mother," she continued,
turning round and looking up, as Lurlee entered, "he asked her,
and she has agreed; and you are witness of it as well as I."</p>

<p>"I am witness," said the lady; "I have heard all, and I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[503]</a></span>
content. Alla and the Prophet have answered my prayers. Ah!
I shall have a precious child to give to thee, Fazil, ere long."</p>

<p>"Put her hands into mine, mother," he replied. "It will feel
real, that she is to belong to me hereafter: it will be an earnest of
the end."</p>

<p>"It is not one of the orthodox customs, Fazil," said the lady,
gravely and hesitatingly: "and I never saw it done at any betrothment;
nevertheless, wait an instant&mdash;I will return directly."</p>

<p>She did so, while they sat as before, bearing a silver salver&mdash;on
which there were some pieces of sugar-candy, and seated herself by
them.</p>

<p>"Thou art still a Brahmun," she said to Tara, "but thou wilt
take one of these from thy mother? There," she continued, as she
put a piece into each of their mouths, repeating the blessing, "Bismilla!
It is done; ye cannot go back. There should be rejoicing,
and music, and feasting; but,&mdash;Bismilla! it is done, and ye cannot
retract. O children! O children!" she cried, bursting into a flood of
tears, "I am a widow, and have suffered sore bereavement; but ye
are the light of my eyes and the only joy of my heart now! Here are
her hands, Fazil," and she took up Tara's, and put them into his&mdash;"thine,
boy, till the end!"</p>

<p>Fazil stooped his head, and put his forehead upon them; they
were not withdrawn, and he fancied that the slender fingers closed
on his confidently;&mdash;was it fancy?</p>

<p>"They should know of it, if they live," said Tara hesitatingly,
and with a gasp in her throat; "methinks they do live, mother, and
that I saw them&mdash;there&mdash;at Wye&mdash;my father and mother; but it is
all confused now, and it may have been a dream during my illness."</p>

<p>"O no!" cried the lady, "let them not come between us now, if
they live; but they are not alive, Tara."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not," she said, with a sigh; "nevertheless, if my lord
would send some one and ask. They would be found in Vishnu
Pundit's house at Wye; and if they are dead&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Surely," said Fazil, interrupting her, "I will send Lukshmun
even now. If they are there, they should come on at once; there is
no fear. Could you not send a letter, or a token, Tara?"</p>

<p>"I will write," she replied; "and here is a ring of my mother's
that she loved dearly; it would have been burned with me! Let
them take it; and if my lord would write, too, to say&mdash;to say&mdash;I am
alive, it would be enough."</p>

<p>"It shall be done at once," he said, rising; "O mother, surely
thy science told thee this would be a happy day!"</p>

<p>"See!" exclaimed the lady triumphantly, taking her tablets from
her bodice, "you mock the planets sometimes, son, but see; while you
were speaking I looked. Is not this Wednesday? and, see, here is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[504]</a></span>
Venus ruling the hour as you sat and plighted your faith! O children,
this cannot be wrong, for the sun is just setting, and the work is
finished."</p>

<p>As she spoke, the last gleam of its rays, as it sank in a glory of
gold and crimson, flashed into the apartment, lighting up the girls'
radiant faces, and sparkling upon their rich dresses and golden
ornaments.</p>

<p>"Beautiful as thou art, Tara," continued Lurlee, "thou wilt be
lovelier still when we deck thee as his bride; and so may the blessing of
thy new mother rest upon thee, and the evil I take from thee now,"&mdash;and
she passed her hands over the girl from head to foot,&mdash;"depart
to thine enemies!"</p>

<p>"Ameen! Ameen!" cried Zyna, as Tara, falling upon her neck,
again wept silently those tears of joy which she had with difficulty
repressed.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_LXXXIX" id="CHAPTER_LXXXIX">CHAPTER LXXXIX.</a></h2>


<p>"Well sung!" cried the young Khan cheerfully, and joining in the
general applause which followed a pretty Mahratta ballad which the
hunchback and Ashruf had just sung, to the accompaniment of a lute
played by the former and a small tenor drum by the latter&mdash;"well
sung! Where did ye learn that?" he continued, advancing from the
entrance to the court where he had paused as he came out. "It is
something new."</p>

<p>The men, who were seated or lounging about the entrance hall to
the house, rose and saluted Fazil. It was evident at a glance to Bulwunt
Rao that something had occurred to remove the sad expression
which his lord's face had worn so long; for it had given place to one
radiant with joy, and he exclaimed cheerily,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Thanks be to the gods! it is gone at last, Meah! Never, since
we rode together to Pertâbgurh, have any of us seen a smile on your
face that was worth looking at, or one which was not followed by a
sigh, as much as to regret it had ever been there; so I cry, with thanks
to the gods, the grief is gone at last. What say you, brothers? look
at him; did I speak truly?"</p>

<p>Amidst the hearty responses to this congratulation by his retainers,
Fazil Khan sat down among them, and the hunchback and Ashruf,
stepping forward, assumed the positions of professional ballad-singers,
and saluted him.</p>

<p>"Shall we sing it again, Meah?" asked Lukshmun; "you did not
hear it all. 'Tis a fancy of my own, about a damsel waiting for her
lover, who passes her by with another, and so she goes and weeps."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[505]</a></span></p>

<p>"And we have all been crying over it, Meah," added Bulwunt Rao;
"'tis so sad a tune too&mdash;so plaintive."</p>

<p>"But as I am not in a crying mood, friend," returned Fazil, laughing,
"it would hardly suit me now, so another time&mdash;meanwhile there
is something to be done which is urgent."</p>

<p>"Are we to meet a new army, and take our revenge, Meah?" cried
several of the men. "Ah, we know the country now, and should not
fall into another trap like the first."</p>

<p>"No, no, friends," said the young man sadly, "there is no such
good news as that; 'tis but a private matter of my own, which our
ballad-singers may help, perhaps."</p>

<p>"We, Meah?" exclaimed the hunchback; "thou well knowest,
that if we were bidden to leap into the flames for thee, we would not
hesitate. Speak, that we may hear and do."</p>

<p>"It is somewhat private, friends," said the young man, looking
around. "If I might be alone with these and our old friend for a
little, no one may take offence; you will know all by-and-by."</p>

<p>"Surely not," cried several, rising and going out, followed by the
rest.</p>

<p>"Stay, Bulwunt Rao," said Fazil, putting his hand on his arm,
"your counsel may be of use;" and when they were alone, he continued,
"She will not be content unless she sees her father and mother;
and she declares they are at Wye, and came to her the day she was
to be burned."</p>

<p>"Impossible!" cried Lukshmun; "they are dead, and this must
be some device of the Evil One&mdash;of that old Mother on the hill there,
who wants to get her back; and she has sent spirits in their guise to
mock her. She does such things very often, Meah Sahib, and I don't
like to hear of this."</p>

<p>"Well, they must be substantial spirits," returned Fazil, laughing,
"for she told us that she had heard them speak, and that she thought
her father had lifted her up once. They must be alive."</p>

<p>Lukshmun shook his head. "I did not see him, or hear of him,
at Wye," he said; "and as I know them well, I should have recognized
him and his wife anywhere. And, about the witches&mdash;if I
were to tell you what I know about the Mother's devices," he continued
solemnly, wagging his head, "I should not be believed. Nevertheless&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nevertheless," said Fazil, interrupting him, "thou art to go and
see&mdash;thou and Ashruf. Wilt thou go, lad, if he is afraid of the
witches?"</p>

<p>"To the death," cried the boy cheerfully; while Lukshmun, leaping
up into the air, turned a somersault, and came down where he
stood. "Go!" he said; "yes, Meah. I have a spell against the
Mother and all sorcery, and his majesty the devil to boot, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[506]</a></span>
Pahar Singh taught me. Where are we to go, Meah, and
when?"</p>

<p>"Now," replied Fazil; "take two of the ponies and ride straight
to Wye. Her parents will be found in the house of Vishnu Pundit,
or he will direct you to them. If they are gone home, or to Poona,
or anywhere else, they must be followed up and brought back; and
they will come when that ring is given to her mother&mdash;so she
says."</p>

<p>"They may need money," said the man, musing. "Brahmuns never
move without coin. Something for expenses, is the first thing they
ask of one. Is it not true? Nevertheless, Vyas Shastree is rich
enough. O yes, he knows me, and I can get into Vishnu Pundit's
house, too. Come, lad, we must put on the Byragee's dresses."</p>

<p>Ashruf followed him. While they were absent, Fazil wrote the
letter they were to take, which ran as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<i>To the respectable and learned in the Véds and Shastras, Vyas
Shastree, of Tooljapoor, who is kind to his friends;</i></p>

<p>"<i>From Fazil, son of Afzool Khan, with greetings, and the peace and
salutation of God; and after wishing you health and prosperity&mdash;</i></p>

<p>"<i>You are to know that your daughter Tara is here, with my mother
and sister, in honour and health; but she hath been ill unto death, and
being, by God's favour, restored to life, wishes to see you and her mother
urgently, and sends a token, by which you may be assured she is here.</i></p>

<p>"<i>You will learn more from the bearer, my servant, who is to be trusted;
and I pray you to lose no time in setting out, for we await your coming.
I have sent money for your expenses by him, which you are to be pleased
to use freely.</i>"</p></blockquote>

<p>The hunchback and Ashruf reappeared after a while in their new
costume, which was that of Jogies, or religious mendicants of that
part of the country. Orange-coloured turbans and garments, purposely
torn and ragged, yet withal scrupulously clean; large strings
of wooden beads about their necks, wrists, and ankles; black blankets,
to keep out cold or heat, thrown over their shoulders after a graceful
and picturesque fashion; and the lute and small drum they had used
before. The faces of both were smeared with whiting, and the broad
trident of Vishnu was drawn in red and white paint upon their foreheads.
The hunchback would perhaps have been known by his
figure; but Ashruf, from the smart Mussulman boy, gaily dressed as
became his master's favourite attendant, was utterly transformed,
and could not possibly have been recognized.</p>

<p>"Shabash!" cried Bulwunt Rao and Fazil involuntarily; "it is
complete&mdash;no one could know you."</p>

<p>"Except by this hunched back of mine," said Lukshmun, "I would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[507]</a></span>
wager that I went anywhere as anybody you please, Meah,&mdash;from the
holiest Syud down to the lowest Kullunder&mdash;from the Secretary of
Ramdas Swâmi himself, to what I am now,&mdash;and was not discovered.
Hindu or Mussulman, 'tis all the same&mdash;only I must have a religious
garb on, Meah Sahib: for my mind, you see, having that turn naturally,
I am most at home in one. Did any one suspect us when we
sang ballads in the ambush at Jowly, and found out what Moro
Trimmul wanted to do? or in Wye, when we saw Tara? O Meah!
this is a joyful errand, for I shall pay a rupee to a Brahmun, and get
bathed in the river&mdash;just where they were going to burn Tara Bye&mdash;to
wash away my sins, and be absolved from shedding a Brahmun's
blood. The gods forgive me if I killed him!"</p>

<p>"I hope you did," returned Fazil, laughing: "and now, here is a
purse of gold, tie it round you, and use what is needed; and here are
the letters which are to be put into Vyas Shastree's own hand. If he
cannot get mine read, this ring and her letter will be enough. If
they are gone to Poona, or back to Tooljapoor, send Ashruf back to
me, and go on thyself."</p>

<p>"To the top of Mount Méru, or the lowest deep of Nurruk," cried
Lukshmun, snapping his fingers. "Fear not; we will bring them,
lad&mdash;won't we? and, master, if I have to go on, and can send thee a
letter by a sure hand, may I take on my son here? I cannot sing
ballads without him."</p>

<p>"Ah yes, my lord!" pleaded the lad, joining his hands, "to bring
them to her."</p>

<p>"Good," said Fazil; "I trust you both. Go, and be discreet, and
God's blessing and mine be with you."</p>

<p>"And now, my lord," said the hunchback, "let us sing one ballad
before we depart&mdash;one that she must know well: it will give her hope.
Go and tell her that some singers are here who know the ballads of
the Bâlâ Ghaut, and will sing her one. She will recognize the tune,
for I have heard her father sing it, and they say he wrote it for her,
for her name is in it. We shall sing it before Vishnu Pundit's door
at Wye."</p>

<p>"As thou wilt," replied Fazil; "I will tell her;" and he arose and
went to the inner court door. "Do not follow me," he said to them&mdash;"she
can hear from hence, and there are women within&mdash;it is
private."</p>

<p>Fazil had watched Tara as the prelude began, and he beckoned her
to the door. "Come and listen," he said; "they are singers of your
own country, and I have brought them to sing a ballad to you." She
arose, and Zyna followed her.</p>

<p>The hunchback and Ashruf stood at the doorway without, and,
after a short prelude, sang, as nearly as we can translate it, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[508]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="center">1.</div><br />
"Fast her tears fell&mdash;faster, faster,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As the days pass slowly by,</span><br />
And her heart is sorely laden<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With the dreary, hopeless sigh.</span><br />
O that cruel, ceaseless sighing!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Weary tears which sadly fell,</span><br />
All unheeded as she wept them<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Daily by the garden well.</span><br />
<br />
<div class="center">2.</div><br />
"Mother! Mother! oft she pleaded,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Toolja Máta! hear my vow!</span><br />
Hear thy daughter's cry of sorrow&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Why shouldst thou forsake me now?</span><br />
Not less thine, O Mother holy!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If my lover come to me;</span><br />
If he come, a golden necklace<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We, thy children, vow to thee!</span><br />
<br />
<div class="center">3.</div><br />
"As she went for water daily,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Raised alone the pitcher still,</span><br />
She repeats the prayer and promise,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As with tears her soft eyes fill!</span><br />
The goddess watched the weary maiden,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And her daily burthen borne;</span><br />
'Faithful,' she cries, 'in earthly sorrow,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Daughter true, no longer mourn!'</span><br />
<br />
<div class="center">4.</div><br />
"Then next morn, with anklets tinkling,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The maiden tripped, and ceased to sigh;</span><br />
As she stooped to raise the pitcher&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Light she felt it lifted high.</span><br />
And sweet words he whispers to her&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Tara, all thy sorrow past!</span><br />
Faith and hope have won thy lover.'<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the vow?&mdash;'Twas paid at last."</span><br />
</div>

<p>It was one of those plaintive Mahratta airs, at once so musical
and tender, and whose character is so original, as to deserve the rank
of national music. How often Tara had heard it! Her father had
written the words, and composed the air, to amuse her when she used
to be sad; but she had no lover&mdash;no one then to take the burden, to
help to lift the pitcher, which was so heavy! Ah yes! she remembered
it well, and that her father had said afterwards, it should
not be sung in the house because it made her sadder, for there could
be no lover.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[509]</a></span></p>

<p>So she listened, and the melody seemed to strike some new and
tender chords in her memory, which as yet had been untouched; and
they looked at her wonderingly, and in silence, as the features softened
into a smile, and the eyes gradually filled with tears, which flowed
as from a fountain within, and rolled silently down her cheeks. As
the vow was named, they saw her hand rise to her neck and unclasp
the heavy gold necklace she wore, and when the last words were sung
she put it into Fazil's hands.</p>

<p>"Let the Mother have it," she said, "as our vow&mdash;she is not angry
with me. You will not deny this, my lord, to Tara?"</p>

<p>Before they could answer her, a strange brightness seemed to come
over her face and eyes, as she looked upward as if following a vision.
"It is enough," she said gently, after a silence which they did not
break; "the Mother is not angry with me&mdash;it is accepted, and I am
free; for when the trial came, she says, and Gunga called me, I did
not leave her."</p>

<p>They did not understand then, to what she alluded; but it was
evident that the excited spirit had again wandered into the past, and
had returned, more at peace than before.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Fazil, "as thou wilt, beloved&mdash;thy vow shall be truly
paid, at last."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XC" id="CHAPTER_XC">CHAPTER XC.</a></h2>


<p>On the second morning Fazil's messengers reached Wye, without
interruption, tethered their ponies in the courtyard of a temple,
where they obtained shelter, and set about the work they had to do
without loss of time. Taking their instruments, they wandered into
the bazar, and sang their ballads to willing listeners; for the hunchback
was a master of his art, and had a willing and skilful pupil in
the boy.</p>

<p>"Wast thou not in the camp at Jowly?" said a man coming up
to Lukshmun, "and this lad too, before we attacked the Toorks,&mdash;and
we let thee go? Ah yes, and you promised to sing the hymn of
the goddess at Tooljapoor, and did not return when we were victorious!
Ill for you, for you would have had a share of the gold.
By the Mother! you shall sing it now. Come with me!"</p>

<p>"Not so," said Lukshmun; "we are engaged to sing at Vishnu
Pundit's house&mdash;where is it?&mdash;and shall be free in the evening only
and if thou canst direct me to one Moro Trimmul, a Brahmun, and
let me go now, we will sing an hour at night for as many as you choose
to bring to the temple of Ballajee, where we have put up, and take
what you have to give us."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[510]</a></span></p>

<p>"Moro Trimmul!" cried the man laughing, "thou wouldst have
to go deep into hell for him. Where hast thou been, friend, that his
fate did not come to thine ears?"</p>

<p>"I was afraid," replied the hunchback; "I fear fighting, sir; and
if a drawn weapon is flashed in my face, I faint. So we ran away
from Jowly&mdash;did we not, my son? and have been travelling about the
country ever since, getting what we can. But what of the Brahmun,
sir? was he killed in the fight at Jowly?"</p>

<p>"No, no&mdash;not there," replied the man; "but he is dead, nevertheless.
Some one cut him down the day the Sutee was carried off."</p>

<p>"Ah yes, I have heard of that, sir; the people have strange stories
about it; but who carried her off? and who killed the Brahmun?
A Brahmun slain! O the impiety!" continued Lukshmun devoutly;
"think of that, my son! A holy Brahmun!"</p>

<p>"I don't know; I was not there," replied the man; "we were
still out at Jowly, or it would not have happened: but they said some
of Afzool Khan's men, who were starving, made a Duróra on the
Sutee, and carried her off; as to Moro Trimmul, he was no loss&mdash;a
bad man, my friend, though a Brahmun. They might have spared
the girl, however, for all the use she was to the Brahmuns afterwards.
I wonder no one kept her, for she was very lovely, they say."</p>

<p>"O sir," cried the hunchback innocently; "and did she not live?
Who killed her?"</p>

<p>"They say not," he replied; "and that the cruel men killed her for
the ornaments she wore. There was a woman's corpse found some
days afterwards on their track, and the remains were brought here,
and her father was told of it. They say he went mad after that,
for he believed they were his child's. He married Moro Trimmul's
sister, you know. Ah, it is a curious story altogether."</p>

<p>"Indeed," returned Lukshmun simply; "I should like to hear it
all. If I sing for you to-night will you tell it to me?"</p>

<p>"A bargain!" cried the man joyfully; "come to us without fail;
we are a jovial lot, and there may be good liquor, and some of the
dancers too. I will come for thee. 'Faith, the story of the Moorlee's
murder by Moro Trimmul is as good as a scene in a play."</p>

<p>"What Moorlee?"</p>

<p>"O, the Tooljapoor girl, Gunga, who was with him. They found
her body under the window of his room at Pertâbgurh, hanging in
the trees below the precipice, and so the whole came out; but he was
dead before then. One of those dare-devil Mussulmans had killed
him, and they took some of the Sutee wood, and burnt him there, by
the river."</p>

<p>"Ai Bhugwân! O Lord, forgive me for having slain the Brahmun,"
ejaculated the hunchback to himself; "and I did it too.
Well, I can't help hitting hard when I do hit; and truly he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[511]</a></span>
murdered some one, it appears, so it was only justice after all. Yes,
sir," he continued, "I understand. And the Sutee's father?&mdash;her
name was T&mdash;T&mdash;T&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Tara," said the man; "and her father is Vyas Shastree of Tooljapoor.
He is better now, and I saw him a while ago sitting by the
porch of Vishnu Pundit's door, weak, but better; people pity him
very much. Now I must go. You will not forget?"</p>

<p>"No," said the hunchback; "you will find me at the temple after
the lamps are lighted; till then we must sing about the streets.
Come, my son. Let us hurry on, boy," continued Lukshmun. "I
know the house. Do not pretend to notice any one; we will sing
the ballad of the Vow, after the first invocation."</p>

<p>They passed on rapidly: up a few cross streets and alleys, till they
reached that in which was the house that they sought. In the
covered alcove, beside the outer door, sat several Brahmuns, apparently
talking together; one elderly man, covered with a sheet, was
reading.</p>

<p>Lukshmun and Ashruf began to sing their ballads at the doors of
every house as they advanced, and women from within, came out and
gave them handfuls of flour or rice, which were dropped into the
bag which Lukshmun carried. Gradually, as they came nearer, the
hunchback changed the songs to those of his own country, Canarese
and Mahratta in turn, and he was sure there must be some, with
which the Shastree was familiar.</p>

<p>Yes, it was he, reading, while the others sat near him, and conversed
among themselves; thinner than when the hunchback had
last seen him, and looking weak, yet still remarkable and unmistakable.
Once or twice the Shastree had looked up at the singers,
not so as to seem to care about their performance, but as if a familiar
sound had reached him. Now, however, it came to the turn of the
Pundit's house, and the hunchback and Ashruf stopped before it.</p>

<p>"Go on," said one of the Brahmuns impatiently; "you have been
bawling all down the street, disturbing our meditations, and the
Shastree there is weak. Go on, and make no noise."</p>

<p>"Maharaj," said Lukshmun, humbly putting up his hands, "we
are under a vow, made before the Holy Mother at Tooljapoor" ("May
she forgive me for telling the lie!" he thought parenthetically), "to
sing before every house in Wye, and bring her what we get; 'tis a
good work, learned sirs, and we are poor people,&mdash;do not hinder us;
'tis a long way to go, and we are weary. Let us sing you a ballad
for our vow, or only a verse, else we cannot go on."</p>

<p>"Make haste then," said the first spokesman impatiently.</p>

<p>Lukshmun returned the lute; and as he played the prelude which
Tara had heard, he saw Vyas Shastree, who had not noticed him, look
up. His large eyes were opened to the full, and he leaned forward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[512]</a></span>
with an expression of intense curiosity. Then the singers broke at
once into the ballad:&mdash;</p>

<p>
"Fast her tears fell&mdash;faster, faster,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As the days pass slowly by."</span><br />
</p>

<p>"Hold!" he exclaimed, waving his hand; "who are ye? and
whence come ye?"</p>

<p>"From Tooljapoor, O Pundit," said the hunchback humbly.</p>

<p>"Who taught you that ballad?"</p>

<p>"No one taught it me. I heard it, and have remembered it. They
say one Vyas Shastree composed it. Maybe you have heard of him,
sir. He had a daughter named Tara. She was a Moorlee. I have
heard they are all dead now."</p>

<p>"Ye belong to Tooljapoor?"</p>

<p>"No, Maharaj; I am from near Allund&mdash;a long way from this;
but the vow I made is for" ("The gods forgive me if I tell another
lie!" he said inwardly)&mdash;"for a&mdash;child&mdash;O kind sir; if the Mother
will send me one. Your worship speaks Canarese?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the Shastree, replying in that language; "who art
thou?"</p>

<p>"Do they understand it?" asked the hunchback.</p>

<p>"No," he replied, "none but my wife, and she only a little. Why
dost thou ask?"</p>

<p>"Can I go into the court? I know all the ballad, and can sing it
sweetly for the women; they always like it," returned Lukshmun.
"Will you listen, Maharaj? 'tis not very long;" and as they went in,
they sang on more loudly and confidently than before. Some
women of the house came and looked at them, and listened, and
among them were Anunda and Radha. The hunchback looked from
the Shastree to his elder wife, and saw the tears falling from both
their eyes; at last the Shastree rose and went in to her, and when
Anunda saw him, she burst into bitter weeping.</p>

<p>"Grieve not for one at rest," Lukshmun heard him say; "at rest
in the peace which was denied her here. Yet the old ballad moves
me strongly, wife. Come hither," he cried to the singers; "take
this for the sake of.... No matter now; I am Vyas Shastree,
and what strange chance hath sent you I know not, but take this,"
and he offered money.</p>

<p>"The gods be thanked! No; not from you," exclaimed Lukshmun,
in Canarese. "Come aside," he continued in the same tongue,
"for I have that to tell you and her, which will give you new life
and strength. Listen," and he whispered in the Shastree's ear;
"Tara lives, well and in honour. I bear a token and a letter which
she hath sent you. Come, and I will give it; 'tis for her mother,
and this letter for thee," and he took it from a fold in his turban.</p>

<p>"Anunda! O wife!" cried the Shastree, trembling and gasping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[513]</a></span>
for breath, as he leaned on her, opening the letter. "She lives&mdash;our
Tara. Come&mdash;he knows of her; see her own writing, the holiest
and most secret Muntra I taught her; she hath written it."</p>

<p>"Away with ye!" cried Radha to the other women about, "this
is not for your ears;" and the group were left alone; for Radha, advancing,
shut the door of the court, and stood there with them.</p>

<p>"Do ye know this?" asked Lukshmun, when he had disengaged
the ring from his inner garment. "Lady, it was to be given to
thee, if thou art her mother! She is well who gave it to me, three
days ago."</p>

<p>Her mother! Who could doubt it who saw Anunda then? The
piece of gold spoke a thousand loving greetings to her. She laughed
and cried by turns. She could speak nothing intelligibly. She
kissed it rapturously, and hugged it close to her bosom, then looked
at it till the tears rained from her eyes, and again did the same. A
new life! a new daughter! born again, as it were. Anunda could
not believe it.</p>

<p>"Thou art mocking us," she said at last, as a revulsion of feeling
appeared to possess her. "This was among the jewels given to
Jánoo Näik, when ... she never got it."</p>

<p>"True," replied Lukshmun, "and she has the rest," and he
enumerated them; "and here is a letter about her from my master,
with whom she is. Listen to me, I can tell you better than that
writing."</p>

<p>Listen? ah yes, to the sweetest tale they had ever heard, did they
listen for hours. The Brahmuns at the door wondered, and the
people from within came and looked and wondered too, why the
Jogies sat here talking to the Shastree&mdash;but still they sat. Once,
for a moment, the Shastree's cruel belief rose up against him, and
forbade him to see an outcast; but nature asserted its own. "They
dare not meddle with me," he thought, "and we cannot be as she
is. But no matter, we will go to her, wife; yes, we will go to-morrow.
Get the things ready. Thou wilt guide us, friend?"</p>

<p>"And guard ye, too, with our lives," said Lukshmun. "Yes, to-morrow
early, we will set out."</p>

<p>And so next day Vishnu Pundit and his friends marvelled that
the Shastree and his family left them so suddenly, and knew not
why they went, or whither.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XCI" id="CHAPTER_XCI">CHAPTER XCI.</a></h2>


<p>We need not relate how the hunchback was washed clean from his
sins, how he and his companion entertained those who came to them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[514]</a></span>
that night, nor how he resisted their temptations to stay and sing to
others, who, they told him, would load him with gold. Those he
was taking to his master were more precious than gold; and
the same anxiety to present them to him in safety, was shared
equally by Fazil and by Tara while awaiting their arrival.</p>

<p>Five days,&mdash;two to go and three to return&mdash;perhaps more; never
had time appeared so interminable to those who remained at Kurrar:
never had journey appeared so wearisome to the Shastree. The
spirit within him was strong and earnest, but he had suffered much;
and, till roused by the hunchback's tidings, Anunda and Radha
feared that he had sunk into that lethargic apathy which often precedes
death. He could not be awakened from it. Had Tara died a
Sutee, it might have been endured. Excitement and religious enthusiasm,
even the glory of the voluntary sacrifice, would have
deadened nature for a while, at least, in both her parents; but the
attack upon the sacred procession, though but one had died in it, by,
as they supposed, lawless robbers&mdash;and the subsequent murder, as
they believed, of their child&mdash;had produced a revulsion which, to
the Shastree, had wellnigh proved fatal, and for many days those
about him gave up hope of life. The remains, as they supposed, of
Tara had, as we know, been brought in, and burned by the river-side
with all due ceremony; and after the period of mourning and
impurity had passed, the Shastree and his wives were to have set
out on their return home. Still, however, they lingered; for the
climate had not agreed with Anunda, who had, in her turn, fallen
ill with fever, and they could not travel.</p>

<p>During this period, they had heard from friends much of what
had befallen Tara: and yet not all of Moro Trimmul's share in her
misfortunes. The only person who could have told them truly was
Gunga, and she was dead. Radha had her own suspicions of her
brother; but beyond his wild attempt on the day of the Sutee, to
induce her to put Tara into his power, she had not seen him; and
his violent death, while it affected her mournfully, ended her anxieties
ere the murder of Gunga was discovered.</p>

<p>It was with difficulty that the impatience of the Shastree and
Anunda could be restrained. They reached and passed Sattara the
first day, and would fain have travelled by relays of men without
resting, but the hunchback and Bulwunt Rao, when they joined him,
would not hear of increased exertion. "I will write by a speedy
messenger that you are safe," he said; "but if I do not bring you in
well to them, my lord will be angry, therefore submit yourselves to
necessity,"&mdash;as, indeed, they were obliged to do.</p>

<p>Of his master's intentions, the hunchback had said nothing. Who
was he, to know anything about them? The lady Tara was in
honour as a guest; that was all he knew. Yes, his master had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[515]</a></span>
carried her off. Could he know that one who had been his guest,
and had truly eaten of his salt, was to be burned alive, and not
make an effort to save her? and she was still a Brahmun, and had
Brahmun women attending upon her.</p>

<p>But Bulwunt Rao, who waited their coming at a village on the
road with an escort of the Paigah, had no such discretion, and told
what he believed&mdash;that Fazil and Tara had been privately betrothed.
The lady Lurlee, he said, had one day distributed sugar-candy and
pân to all the household, and to the mosque and other holy places in
the town: and some had been sent to him on a silver salver covered
with a cloth of brocade. What did that mean? And when the
Shastree remonstrated, with a natural horror, at the idea of a Brahmun
girl marrying a Mussulman, Bulwunt Rao replied curtly&mdash;</p>

<p>"What could you do with her, Shastree, if you had her? You
see she is no longer a Brahmun, but an outcast. You could not
even give her water; and the two old Brahmun women who attended
her in her illness, and the one who now waits on her, will
have to be purified with plenty of ceremonies&mdash;and plenty to pay
for them, too, will be needed; but do not care for that, Shastree,
my lord is very wealthy. So, you see, we must give her up as a
Hindu, and even let her go into the other faith."</p>

<p>The Shastree would groan at these home truths, but could reply
nothing. As to his wife, she rejoiced heartily, and had no misgiving.
The expression of a mother's nature would not be denied to Anunda;
for there is no mother with the experience of a life's love grown
into her heart, who does not rejoice in the thought of a wife's useful
happiness to her daughter, and in the expectation of its fruits!
All that had been done to soothe Tara, to distract her mind, to fill
up the vacant place there with other interests&mdash;learning, religious
exercise, and devotion to the service of the goddess&mdash;had been tried
in turn, and were, as Anunda felt, but a mockery.</p>

<p>Possibly, most probably, indeed, under other circumstances, Tara's
pure mind would eventually have taken refuge in asceticism, and
those severe penances, in which the woman who had persecuted her
at Pertâbgurh, had grown to take delight; but, knowing the too
frequent condition of the indulgence of lawless love by women
situated like her daughter, and exposed to the same temptations,
Anunda had often trembled for her safety; and yet owned to herself
that, to doubt her, was profanation.</p>

<p>No, she could not object. Had she been simply asked the question
previously, as a proud Brahmun woman, she must have refused.
Now, circumstances had put that far beyond her reach. To object,
would not retard the final issue, or influence it in any way; but to
consent joyfully, would add so much, and so supremely to Tara's
happiness, that opposition quickly grew to be an impossibility in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[516]</a></span>
good lady's mind: and before she came to the end of the first day's
journey, Fazil himself could not have desired a warmer advocate.</p>

<p>A good deal of this fell out from being left to herself. Palankeens
had been hired; and as the three travellers were carried on singly
for hours together, each had fallen into the train of thought most
congenial. Radha had certainly no voice in the matter, but was
delighted. Anunda, between joy for her recovered child, and her
new prospects of an honourable life, had been wellnigh beside herself
at first, and the quiet soothing motion of the litter was of all
things the best, perhaps, to calm her, and bring her practical mind
into perception of the true realities of the position. "We have
mourned her as dead," she said to herself, "we have performed all
the ceremonies, and distributed all the charities necessary for the
occasion; now she is alive after all, and born again into a new
faith; so the death which we believed in, was a type of what was to
be fulfilled. I see it all now," she said to herself, "and so it has
been ordered for her without the pain of burning. Strange, my
husband does not see this, but I will tell it to him when we arrive."</p>

<p>And so she did. Radha, too, caught up this tone of argument as
best suited to her husband's mind, and the two women agreeing, left
him little to say. It did not appear he had anything to urge or to
object. "This is some punishment for her sins in an earlier life," he
said to Anunda; "and 'tis well it is no worse."</p>

<p>Anunda and Radha could not see the punishment, except that Tara
would have to eat unclean things; otherwise, what was left to be
desired?</p>

<p>If this was their deliberate opinion at the close of the first day's
march,&mdash;the second day, and the quiet jogging motion of the litters,
the change of air and scene, and the peace which had settled gradually
into their hearts, had much more than confirmed it. Whatever there
was of objection, was dealt with on the first evening; and on the
second, as they rested for the night, impatience to see their child once
more, an irrepressible yearning to place her happiness beyond doubt,
or chance of mishap, had driven out all other feeling. So, on the
third morning, as they entered their litters for the day's journey, and
knew they would reach Kurrar before sunset, Anunda, who laughed
and cried by turns in a strange manner, as she dressed their morning
meal herself before they set out, saw, with a thankful heart, that the
heavy care which had sat on her husband's spirit for so long had
passed away, and his old placid, benign expression, had taken its
place.</p>

<p>That afternoon, as the sun's rays lengthened, and were filled with
that golden radiance which clothed the meanest objects with glory,
and lighted up the town and fort, and the camp beyond,&mdash;the little
procession of the three palankeens, and the small body of horsemen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[517]</a></span>
approached the town gate. Bulwunt Rao had timed their arrival to
suit the lady Lurlee's desire, for the astrological tables had been once
more consulted, and the Moollas of several mosques had been obliged
to declare the most fortunate hour for the entry of the party into the
town. Messengers, too, had met them, enjoining care in this respect;
and Bulwunt Rao and the hunchback were both relieved by the
appearance of a last emissary at the gate to express approval of their
arrangements and to urge them on.</p>

<p>No need of hastening now. The bearers themselves were in hurry
enough; for Bulwunt Rao's promise had been liberal, and they had
kept the horsemen at a brisk canter for the last few miles of the
journey. Now, therefore, shouting and hallooing to each other, the
men who carried the litters, rushed through the gate of the town,
and up the main street at their utmost speed; and there was a race
between the three sets, in which Anunda's were victorious, and
clamoured for largesse as they set down her palankeen before the
door of the kind merchant's house where Tara still was. Much the
good lady had deliberated in her mind whether she could ever be
touched by Tara without pollution, and whether it could be avoided;
and we believe we are correct in saying that she had determined, if
it were to cost her half, or all the money she had left in the banker's
hands at Tooljapoor, she did not care, but she must hold her child
once more to her heart.</p>

<p>Could she have repressed it? Ah no! a very outcast in shame, in
misery, in misfortune&mdash;no matter had it been so&mdash;the loving mother's
heart would still have been open, as her arms, to receive her child;
but in Tara's renewed life, as it were, in joy and in honour, what
signified the temporary impurity of contact with one only impure by
the hard rules of their sect? Anunda trembled very much, and
scarcely knew how she got out of the litter; but as she emerged, a
figure she could hardly see for the tears which blurred her sight, and
which seemed to swim before her, bowed down and kissed her feet,
was raised up, and, failing on her neck, wept aloud. Then it was
strained to her heart with a face buried in her bosom which dare not
look up, till her father and Radha entered, and Tara, prostrating herself
before him, clung to his knees sobbing. With him, too, some
scruple about touching her had remained; but his emotion on sight
of her could not be resisted, and he raised her up and blessed her as
of old. I do not think any of them could speak, and if they did say
anything, it was not intelligible enough to be recorded, and is better
imagined.</p>

<p>Then Anunda sat down, for she was very dizzy: and Tara saw
the loving arms stretched out, and went and lay down in them on the
soft bosom in her old place, and hid her face there, and felt her
mother's tears fall hot and fast upon it, while her own were wiped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[518]</a></span>
away by the dear bands that had often wiped them before. By-and-by
she looked up, and her mother saw in the clear soft eye, in the
ineffable expression of her countenance, that all trouble and anxiety
was past. No more excitement now, false and mocking, even though
sustained by religious fervour; and the peaceful calm which had
grown upon the face since her recovery, was a new expression to her
mother, which she felt could not change again.</p>

<p>Then Lurlee came with Zyna presently, when the Shastree had
been sent away, and, putting Tara aside, Anunda arose and bowed
before her, kissing her feet, and embracing her knees. "She is thy
child now, lady," she said; "take a mother's thanks and gratitude
for her honour and her life. In our simple Hindu fashion, we know
no other salutation, else it would be given."</p>

<p>"Nay, not to me, but to Alla, who hath preserved her&mdash;not we,"
replied Lurlee. "Noble ye are, though of another faith. Let us embrace
as sisters, to whom our mutual God hath given one daughter."</p>

<p>"It must be done, sooner or later," said Anunda to herself, as she
withdrew from Lurlee's arms, "and better at once. Come hither,
Tara: see how soon I give thee away, my child, after I have recovered
thee. Wilt thou forgive me? Take her, lady," she continued, putting
Tara into Lurlee's arms; "thou art more her mother now, than I.
She hath been born to thee in a new life; be it as thou wilt unto her."</p>

<p>"I take her," replied Lurlee, "as she is given, freely and truly. I
had no child, lady, and often had prayed for one, and Alla and the
Prophet gave her to me long ago, before all this misery, and when
my lord lived, who would have rejoiced with us to see this day had
he been spared. Yes, believing you dead, we took her to be our
child, he and I. Now you have given her to me, and the gift is
precious and is accepted: but I will not take it yet; we are proceeding
home, and you will come with us,&mdash;we will travel together. When
we arrive, I will receive her; till then, let her remain with you; as
yet she is pure from us&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, mother, I am pure, I have transgressed nothing," said Tara
gently. "I know," she continued, interrupting Anunda, "I am not
as before; but you can give me what I need till&mdash;till ... and
there is no help for it now." Anunda and the Shastree did not object,
and so it was settled among them.</p>

<p>How much they had to learn of each other's acts! Nor was it till
Tara told all, and they understood what the infamy of Moro Trimmul's
conduct had been, that they felt the true honour of Fazil's character,
or the deep loving kindness of the lady Lurlee and his sister. A
grateful subject was this, now that she could speak unreservedly with
Radha and her mother, and Tara had to repeat her tale again and
again to willing ears. Sometimes her father, too, listened wonderingly;
and there was no part of it upon which he dwelt with more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[519]</a></span>
pride, even to rapture, than Tara's simple relation of the ordeal, and
her devotion of herself to a cruel death rather than to dishonour.</p>

<p>"A true Brahmun thou," he would say, passing his hand over her
head as she read him the old lessons, "and thou wilt not forget these,
nor the Mother. If thou hadst failed, even to death, she had not
released thee from thy vow. As it is, see, she would not be denied a
life! He used to scoff at her, and she drank his blood&mdash;not thine, my
faithful child, not thine&mdash;and gave thee a new life, which will be
happy. Yes, the Khánum's skill in astrology is good, for my own
calculations confirm her results, and, comparing his scheme of
nativity with thine, Tara, there is no discordance." But, nevertheless,
the fact of Fazil's being born a Moslem and Tara a Hindu, often
puzzled Vyas Shastree more than his science could explain, or than
he cared to acknowledge.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XCII" id="CHAPTER_XCII">CHAPTER XCII.</a></h2>


<p>There were many cogent reasons, public as well as private, why Fazil
Khan's presence in Beejapoor was urgently required. Soon after
his arrival at Kurrar, he had received the King's letter of condolence
on his father's loss, with confirmation of all his estates and
privileges, and with them a private letter in the King's own writing,
urging him to come on without delay. The full effect of the
destruction of the army had as yet, perhaps, hardly been felt, and
the means of retrieving the disaster, or repelling the invasion which
was likely to follow, were difficult to devise. As usual, the royal
counsels were much distracted; but, young as he was, the character
which Fazil Khan had acquired among the soldiery during the few
short months of this campaign had raised him already to a rank far
beyond that of his contemporaries, and even many of his elders.
Only for Tara's long illness he would have proceeded to Beejapoor
immediately after his arrival at Kurrar, and left the duty of collecting
the fugitives to others; but that had rendered delay unavoidable,
and all those who had escaped slaughter had joined him. On the
other hand, Kowas Khan wrote that his preparations for the fulfilment
of his marriage-contract were complete, and protested against
further delay: and when the days of mourning for his father should
expire, Fazil had no valid excuse for procrastination. In this the
lady Lurlee agreed perfectly, and her idea of a double marriage in
the family was by no means unacceptable.</p>

<p>In truth that long-desired event much occupied the good lady's
thoughts, almost, indeed, engrossing them. What preparations
would not have to be made! and all by her. There were Zyna's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[520]</a></span>
clothes and Tara's to be put in hand immediately; there were stores
of flour, and butter, and spices, and sugar to be laid in, flocks of
sheep to come from Afzoolpoor, all the dancing women in Beejapoor
to be engaged, fireworks to be made, and sweetmeats without end.
All the new bridal ornaments had to be designed and executed, and
this was no easy matter. Inshalla! however, she was determined it
should all be done; and when Lurlee Khánum took anything into
her head, there was less difficulty, perhaps, in doing it, than with
others who talked more.</p>

<p>They did not tarry now. An express was sent to the capital that
they had determined to leave Kurrar on the ensuing Monday, and
Lurlee was more than ever particular that on this, their last voluntary
journey, all that could be done to insure its being propitious,
should be observed. They were to travel south-eastward, and Monday
was the sixth day of the month, so that the mysterious "Murdan-ool-Ghyb"
(the invisible being) was behind them, as he ought to be.
The old tablets showed, too, that Venus ruled the hour before noon,
which was a very convenient time for starting, because everyone would
have bathed and eaten, and they could travel on till evening without
difficulty. Now, too, the weather was cool, nay, the air was positively
cold in the early mornings, when exposure to it was not wholesome,
and all their preparations were made accordingly. As they were
about to enter their litters, the good lady made both the girls and
Fazil look at themselves in a glass, which was the crowning ceremony
of all; and we believe that there never were merrier faces, or
a journey begun in truer hope, and with more thankful hearts.</p>

<p>True, Lurlee missed the familiar countenance which, though
sometimes it used to look kindly on her, and sometimes was impatient,
was in the main a loving one&mdash;sadly,&mdash;very sadly; and as
the city grew nigh, she had a dread, shared by Zyna and her brother,
that the first days in the old house would be inexpressibly painful.
So, also, when remembrances of the dear old Khan came over her, the
good lady would weep plentifully and be the better of it; and Goolab
and the cook Kurreema, who, having escaped the Mahrattas, rejoined
her mistress at Kurrar, and had shared all her trials, were ever ready
with pithy consolations, and practical expectations of the blessings
in store for her which, indeed, she was well inclined to believe.</p>

<p>We may say, too, as perhaps hardly unnatural, that Zyna's
approaching marriage was by no means terrible in contemplation:
and the eagerness of her betrothed to have it concluded, gave earnest
of the happiness which she hoped for, indeed felt assured of. We
feel that we do not know much of this young man, and that, if it
had fallen to his lot to accompany the Khan's army, he might have
become a prominent character in this history, and displayed that
devotion for Zyna and his friend Fazil, which we believe he really<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[521]</a></span>
possessed. But after all, perhaps, it was better as it was. Who can
say, for instance, whether he would have escaped the bloody field at
Jowly, or the massacre in the ambush at Pertâbgurh,&mdash;or the deadly
fever of the forests and jungles, which had destroyed so many who
had escaped the sword?</p>

<p>We have no doubt, too, had the lady Lurlee set herself to work to
find out astrological reasons why he did not accompany the Khan,
that they would have been discoverable: but as she had agreed with
her husband that, for the present, he was better away, so she had
left these mysteries unsolved, and the issue to the young man had
been favourable. Not only had his house been put in order in all
respects, and the ceremonies after his father's death completed, but
those preparations begun in which Zyna was so deeply interested,
and of which our friend the Lalla, who, as we know, had been
attached to the young nobleman by Afzool Khan as secretary, wrote
minute and eloquent accounts.</p>

<p>According to him, never had such preparations been made: while
the accomplished scribe exhausted the Gulistan, the Mejnoon-i-Leila,
and other love-stories, for the choicest couplets to adorn his letters,
he not unfrequently composed other verses himself. Most frequently,
too, in the bold rough hand which Kowas Khan wrote, there would
be a postscript to say Fazil (which meant Zyna) was only to believe
him as devoted as ever in all respects; and whenever Fazil gave
these epistles to his sister to read, and directed especial notice to the
postscripts, we are strongly inclined to consider that she found them
by far their most acceptable portions. Under the constitution of
Mussulman society, even had her lover been in camp, he could have
seen nothing of Zyna, and she would have been in stricter seclusion
from him, perhaps, than others. As she was content to take him
upon hearsay, and to trust, like all her people, to after-life with him,
to know him as a lover and husband too, we do not see what business
we have to discuss the matter at all in this narrative.</p>

<p>So the journey was soon over, and little more than a hundred
miles, with a light equipage, was quickly traversed. Lurlee had
written to her old friend, the Moolla of the ward in which they lived,
to send a special messenger to inform her at what hour it would be
lucky to enter the house with two expectant brides in company; and
that worthy, in conjunction with other friends, had duly solved this
knotty question: and sent a return express to meet them at the last
halting-place, wherein all the particulars were duly disclosed, and, we
need not say, most scrupulously observed.</p>

<p>Fazil had wished to ride on several stages in advance and get to
court, where the King looked anxiously for his coming; but Lurlee
would not hear of it. "Who could tell," she said, "what might not
result from so incautious a proceeding? They had met with great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[522]</a></span>
misfortune, which was happily past; were they to risk more? No;
she was positive;" and we believe fully, that they were all much too
happy together, to wrangle with her.</p>

<p>Fazil saw Tara daily; and she and Zyna were little troubled by
Lurlee, who was now busied in consultations with her domestic advisers,
which appeared to be delightfully interminable. Every now
and then, however, she would come into the tent where they sat&mdash;for
Zyna was teaching Tara the pretty embroidery-work she practised
herself&mdash;and, looking at Tara and saying nothing, would pass her
hands over her, and press them against her temples, to remove evil,
and then go away smiling.</p>

<p>Ah yes, she was very precious now. If Zyna or Tara laughingly
asked how much evil could have accumulated in those short intervals,
the good lady would shake her head, and once shocked Zyna by
saying, that she should not think even, of Tara's beauty, lest it should
altogether depart. We believe, however, that Zyna did not fear such
a catastrophe. It was growing much too palpable and real to be
doubted, or to be in danger of fading away: and became only the
greater when, as Zyna looked at it, and whispered something which
was probably a secret between the girls, though Anunda guessed it as
she sat with them, Tara covered her face, or hid it in Zyna's neck, or
in her mother's bosom.</p>

<p>But the first few days after they arrived&mdash;in spite of congratulations
of friends&mdash;of kind messages from the palace&mdash;of piles of Nuzzurs,
or offerings of various kinds&mdash;were melancholy ones to all, yet tempered
with grateful acknowledgements of providential care. Immediately
on arrival, the requisite offerings were despatched to all the
holy places of the neighbourhood and the city itself, as they had
before arranged. The old Moolla, as almoner, collected a strange tribe
of vagrant Fakeers, who were fed to repletion in the large courtyards;
and the Shastree and Anunda made their offerings after their
own fashion, at Hindu temples.</p>

<p>The journey, and the constant association with Lurlee and Zyna,
had done much to reconcile Anunda to Mussulman ways; and, perhaps,
in such matters women are more facile than men, for she was
prepared for the evidences of wealth and rank which she saw on her
arrival; but her husband and Fazil did not make much progress.
The simple Hindu priest could not bring himself to be on an equality
with the young Moslem noble; but he admitted the respect of Fazil
for him gratefully, and a sincere affection sprang up between them
out of it, which, if undemonstrative, was not the less permanent.</p>

<p>All Vyas Shastree now wished for, was the unavoidable termination.
Till it took place he was not in his proper position. Few, if
any, Brahmuns knew the history of Tara in the capital; but he did
not feel justified, being impure, in visiting members of his own sect,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[523]</a></span>
till he had performed expiatory ceremonies, and so, with his wives,
kept himself secluded in a court of the house specially allotted to
him, and the garden we know of, the shade and quiet of which suited
him. Radha, too, required rest and care; and so a month passed, for
Lurlee would not be hurried. She had much on hand, she said, and
must do it after her own fashion; and no one interfered with her and
her assistants.</p>

<p>Perhaps we need not follow the good lady to the end of it; but as
all matters of this kind, when loving care directs them, have an
inevitably happy conclusion, so we are bound to relate that nothing
was wanting here. Tara said that Zyna's marriage might be as
splendid as it could be made, and suited to the rank and condition
of two noble houses; but with her it should be different, and so it
was. If there was a shade of disappointment upon the old lady's
brow, because the son of Afzool Khan was not married with the same
splendour as the son of the late Wuzeer, who had no family to boast
of, it passed away when Fazil himself declared it could not be otherwise,
and the wistful pleading face of Tara confirmed it.</p>

<p>So, as part of the magnificent ceremony which united Zyna to her
betrothed&mdash;the like of which had not been seen in Beejapoor for
years&mdash;Tara was admitted to the Moslem faith, and the blessing of
God and the peace of the Prophet said over her as she repeated the
new creed, received her new name of Ayésha, and was received into
her new home. Then the chief Kazee, who had conducted the
prayers, blessed all, and cried with a loud voice, solemnly&mdash;</p>

<p>"O Lord God! grant that such love may live between these couples,
thy servants, as was between Adam and Eve, Abraham and Sara,
Moses and Sufoora, his highness Mahomed&mdash;on whom be peace&mdash;and
Ayésha. Ameen and ameen!" and all the assembly repeated solemnly,
"Ameen and ameen!"</p>

<p>Some of the old Khan's friends wondered, some sneered, some
blamed the young man's choice, but more congratulated him; for, as
they said, "though she was once an infidel, she is now a true believer;
and, after all, was he not free to choose what would best insure his
own honour and happiness?" We are bound to record, however, that
those matrons who, being privileged friends and guests, were indulged
with a sight of the bride's beautiful face&mdash;as Tara's veil was raised
from amidst the cloud of gauze and silver tissue in which it was enveloped&mdash;did
not wonder at all that it had been irresistible; and there
might have been some envious also, regretting that daughters of their
own had lost their chance in the choice which Fazil had made. So,
to prevent any evil consequences, Lurlee, with her own hands, waved
over Tara's head in succession, tray after tray of lighted lamps and
certain condiments which would infallibly avert evil glances, and
ended by passing her hands over the bride and blessing her. "Mayst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[524]</a></span>
thou be fruitful," she said, embracing her, "and remain, with beauty
undiminished, the joy of thy lord; and may his love for thee increase
till it is fulfilled and perfected in Paradise. So be thou blessed, O my
daughter, altogether!"</p>

<p>Even more fervently did her mother bless Tara. Although Anunda
had cheerfully taken part in those portions of the ceremonies that
were possible without clashing with the observances of her own faith,
yet for the most part they were strange, and she had felt out of place.
But she and her husband were thankful they had witnessed all to the
close&mdash;thankful that Tara had been with them to the last. Henceforth
their lives must be divided, but there was an assurance of
honour and protection to their child which soothed the inevitable
separation, and filled their hearts with hope and trust.</p>

<p>Long she sat alone with them, and they spoke of the future calmly
and joyfully. There had been no misgiving from the first; and while
they could not, if they would, have recalled Tara to their own faith,
they saw in her future life as much of true happiness as they could
have wished for. So they blessed her; and after their own simple
fashion put her hands into Fazil's: and he took her from them, and,
touching their necks, vowed to be faithful, and they believed him.</p>

<p>"They have given thee to me, O beloved," Fazil said to Tara, as
her parents departed on their journey homewards. "Now fear not.
As sacred to me as my vow before the priest, was the last vow to
them. Fear not now, Ayésha!"</p>

<p>"I would rather be Tara to thee, my lord, for ever," she said shyly.
"The little maiden who, once rescued by thee from dishonour, has
lived in thy heart since then, cannot change to thee, even in name."</p>

<p>"Be it so," he replied. "To thy new people be Ayésha; to me,
Tara&mdash;so be witness, my God and thy God&mdash;evermore!"</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XCIII" id="CHAPTER_XCIII">CHAPTER XCIII.</a></h2>

<div class="center"><big>EPILOGUE.</big></div>


<p>Perhaps I ought to have told my fair readers more of the particulars
of this double marriage, but I am afraid they would have found them
as tiresome in the relation, as Zyna and Tara did in actual sufferance
of the nine days of their continuance. We can at least imagine that,
with unlimited means, the jewels and trousseaux provided for both
brides by the lady Lurlee (and these things are as indispensable there
as here) were&mdash;perfection. And we may also state thus much in
confidence, that particular friends were admitted to private views of
them. The young to be envious: the old to be congratulatory&mdash;envious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[525]</a></span>
too, perhaps, who knows?&mdash;for such things happen there as
well as here. Then, as marriage gifts were presented by friends,
there were trays upon trays from the Queen to both of jewels,
brocades, and muslins, which need not be specified; and the royal
lady availed herself of her privilege to see the brides, and put sugar-candy
into both their mouths, wondering at Tara's beauty, and
heartily wishing them both God-speed on their life's journey.</p>

<p>Did not also the poets of the city write verses, and the singers sing
them; and are they not sung there to this day? Were there not
poor folk fed by hundreds, Hindus as well as Mussulmans, and clothed
too? and was there one of the sixteen hundred mosques in the city,
where alms and thank-offerings were not distributed in proportion to
their importance? "No one else remained to be married," said the
lady Lurlee, when she had collected all the poor couples she could
hear of, given them clothes, and had them married with her children.
And, Mashalla! of what had been done, she was in nowise ashamed.
No, indeed; and plenteous were the congratulations and blessings
showered upon her, and upon them all, by high and low.</p>

<p>Vyas Shastree, Anunda, and Radha, remained long enough to see
Tara reconciled to her new station in life, and to appreciate how
irresistibly charming the quiet natural dignity of the Brahmun girl
became, among the new society into which her destiny had thrown
her. But, beloved as she was by many a sincere friend among her
new faith&mdash;as years passed, the devotion borne to her by the retainers
of the house, the farmers on her husband's vast estates, and the poor
everywhere, was most affecting to witness, and increased with time;
and her parents heard with joy and pride, far away in their own
home, of the bounty of the good lady, Ayésha Khánum.</p>

<p>They left their daughter, then, at peace; and her last connection
with the temple, where her father served, and where she was long
remembered, was the presentation to the shrine, of the necklace she
had vowed to it, which was taken there in solemn procession, and
hung round the neck of the image. Some time afterwards, and when
all expiatory ceremonies were completed, Radha's first child was born&mdash;a
son, which Anunda adopted as her own: and in her care for it,
found love and occupation to fill her heart and her time, and to
supply, in some part, Tara's absence.</p>

<p>Mother and daughter met, however, frequently. No entire year
elapsed without a reunion, and in the course of time came children
too, who climbed in turn about the good dame's lap and called her
grandmother. Then her heart clave to them&mdash;strangers though
they were in faith&mdash;and after her own simple fashion she lived much
among them during the latter years of a tranquil and happy life.
Sometimes the Shastree came with her to Beejapoor, but not often.</p>

<p>Fazil Khan lived in stormy times and bore his part in them. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[526]</a></span>
destruction of the force under his father's command had not only
been a sore loss to the King's army, both in <i>matériel</i> and in men,<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
but a vital blow at the very existence of the kingdom and of the
Mussulman power in India. Treacherously as it had been gained,
the Rajah Sivaji did not slumber on his victory. His people were
assured it had been suggested by divine counsel, and carried out by
divine aid, and that their prince thenceforth was an incarnation of
divinity. He, perhaps aided by his mother, believed this of himself,
propagated the belief, and acted upon the effect of it. He was
everywhere active and persevering: now invading the kingdom of
Beejapoor, plundering up to the gates of the capital, and inflicting
rapid and terrible blows in all directions: now attacking the Moghul
posts and forts, and extending his authority until, though professing
subservience to both, he became virtually independent equally of
Dehli and Beejapoor, and finally assumed the state and insignia of a
sovereign.</p>

<p>Fazil Khan had not long concluded his marriage ceremonies, ere
he was called upon to take the command of part of a new army, with
which the King took the field in person. Tara would not leave him,
and shared the fatigue and peril of the new campaign in a manner
which called forth the lady Lurlee's warmest approbation. She had
not been more, she said, to his father than Tara was to his son, and
she always contrasted her practical usefulness and endurance, with
the behaviour of other ladies who could not leave luxurious palaces,
and the state and splendour which had greater charms for them, than
the rough vicissitudes of camp life.</p>

<p>For a time the royal forces succeeded in checking the Mahratta
incursions and restoring tranquillity on the borders, and Fazil Khan
continued, like his father, to render service as a commander whenever
he was called upon; but he could not be induced to take office in the
administration, and as disquiet and intrigue at the capital became
more formidable, retired for the most part to his estate of Afzoolpoor,
near the Bheema river, and usually lived there, visiting Beejapoor
only on occasions of ceremony. He never married again, as the law
would have allowed, and at his death was buried beside his wife in
the mausoleum which his father had built at Afzoolpoor, and where
such of the remains of the old Khan as could be afterwards recovered,
had been deposited. The mausoleum still exists as perfect as when
built, and on the several anniversaries of their deaths, flowers are
strewn by the Mussulman priests of the town and by the people over
their graves, and prayers are said for the repose of their souls in
Paradise.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[527]</a></span></p>
<p>We have said that the Mussulmans of India received their first
material check in the massacre at Pertâbgurh, and we state this
advisedly. That event, in 1657, led as directly to their ruin, and the
steady rise of the Mahrattas, as did the English victory of Plassey, in
1757, to the destruction of both. For though, by the conquests and
subversion of all the independent Mussulman kingdoms of the Dekhan
by Aurungzeeb, the empire of Dehli culminated to its highest splendour,&mdash;it
was not maintained: and rapidly fell to pieces under the
effects of disastrous civil wars on the one hand, and the increasing
power of the Mahrattas on the other. In 1689, Beejapoor was again
attacked by the Moghul armies under the Emperor in person, and,
surrendering by capitulation, ceased to be an independent kingdom.
The rest is matter of general history, with which this particular
chronicle has no concern.</p>

<p>Sivaji died in 1680, after a life which was a stirring romance from
first to last, but not before the power he had aroused and created
had become for the present invincible&mdash;fulfilling his mother's
prophecy, that the Hindu war-cry, "Hur, Hur, Mahadeo!" should
be shouted in victory throughout the land of Hind, in triumph to the
goddess who led it on, from Dehli to Raméshwur.</p>

<p>It was singular that Kowas Khan, with his father's tragical fate
fresh in his memory, should have been unable to resist the same
temptations to treason and treachery. Though he had ceased them
for a while, the Emperor Aurungzeeb renewed his intrigues at Beejapoor;
for Kowas Khan, who became regent of the State after the
King Ali Adil Shah's death, entered into negotiations with the
Moghul general, Khan Jehán, who commanded in the adjoining provinces,
to give a daughter of the royal house in marriage to a son of
the Emperor's, and as the price of this, to hold the kingdom of Beejapoor
himself in dependence, which had been his father's aim also.
The plot was discovered, however, and Kowas Khan was assassinated,
in 1675, eighteen years after the events we have recorded.</p>

<p>Some of his lineal descendants still survive, and the memory of the
lady Zyna and of her beauty lives among them. There is a noble
mausoleum on the west side of the town of Suggur, in the province
of Shorapoor, which, at the period of which we write, belonged to
this family. It was begun by the "Wuzeer" of Beejapoor, and
finished by his son Kowas Khan: and in it the remains of the lady
Zyna and her husband rest, under the care of their descendants, who,
now reduced in circumstances, have preserved a small village with
its lands, which adjoins the tomb, as the only remnant of the once
princely estates which were held by their ancestors; and the revenues
of this village, which had originally been assigned in payment of oil
for the mausoleum, are now their only support. They are, however,
most respectable. The soubriquet of Wuzeer is still attached to
them; and the head of the family, Sofee Sahib, still preserves much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[528]</a></span>
of the "aristocratic" dignity of descent. The family palace at Beejapoor,
though deserted, is still standing, and is, or was, one of the
very few private buildings there of which the roof is entire.
Perhaps by this time, however, its owner may have been unable to
resist the price he could obtain for its massive teak timbers. The
roof may have been sold, and the handsome rooms and courts left
open, to decay rapidly under the influence of the seasons.</p>

<p>A few words in relation to some other characters in our history,
and we have done.</p>

<p>Pahar Singh did not long maintain his promise of abstinence from
violence. It had become, together with avarice, the ruling passion
of his character, and led him on, after a while, to fresh outrages; and
though pardoned by the King again and again, in memory of his
strange services, it was impossible, in the end, to overlook the daring
character of his proceedings, and his occupation of royal territories.
Nor was it long before Kowas Khan discovered the active share the
robber chief had taken in his father's murder; and though the King's
acquiescence in that deed was more surmised than ascertained, the
fact of his being acquainted with Pahar Singh's part in it was not
afterwards denied. On an occasion, therefore, when, by a more than
usually serious outrage, the King's pardon had been absolutely withdrawn,
his reduction and punishment became unavoidable,&mdash;Kowas
Khan led an army against the castle of Itga, Pahar Singh was slain
in its defence, his estates confiscated, and the castle and its walls
blown up.</p>

<p>His nephew escaped, but returned to the village to live as a farmer
under reduced circumstances. When Aurungzeeb conquered the
country, he became again "Hazaree," or commander of a thousand,
and the title remained with his descendants, who, however, never
abandoned lawless courses. Long afterwards, a descendant, also
named Pahar Singh, became a leader of Dekhan Pindarees, or freebooters,
after the Mahratta war of 1818-19, and when that crime was
no longer practicable, took to a minor practice of it in highway
robbery. In 1828-29, the family were found to be largely connected
with Dacoity and Thuggee, and the leading members of it were
tried, convicted of both crimes, and sentenced to various terms of
imprisonment, during which their head, Pahar Singh, died.</p>

<p>Persevering to the last, the other members, on their release, again
took to highway robbery on horseback, and for a brief period were
the terror of certain districts in the Dekhan, extending their operations,
too, to distant points; but they were gradually hunted down,<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
and the last six were brought to justice by the writer of this
chronicle in 1850, and sentenced to penal servitude for life. One
member only of the family survives free, and, as late as 1860, was a
private in the police of the &mdash;&mdash; district.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[529]</a></span></p>
<p>Our friend the Lalla, who played a conspicuous part in the early
portion of this history, became a prosperous and wealthy man; but
the question of his honesty remained an open one. He sent for his
family, and settled at Beejapoor, and his talents gained him lucrative
employment in the state. He remained attached to Kowas Khan,
whom he is believed to have corrupted; and, finally, as the kingdom
was on the point of dissolution, he is said to have made peace with
his old master, the Emperor Aurungzeeb, by materially assisting his
designs, and tampering with the nobility and officers of the state
previous to the last investment of the city. He probably returned to
Dehli with the royal camp, for no traces of his family are to be
found in Beejapoor.</p>

<p>Bulwunt Rao remained as he was, the leader of a troop of his own
horses in the Paigah, or household forces of Fazil Khan. When his
cousin and hereditary enemy, Tannajee Maloosray, was killed in that
famous escalade of Singhur, near Poona, which has furnished the
subject of many a Mahratta ballad, Bulwunt Rao went to Sivaji, and
the circumstances he related being well remembered, he obtained
substantial justice in the restoration of his hereditary property.
Sivaji offered him service, which was respectfully declined, and the
motives for refusal being appreciated, he was honourably dismissed.
He married among his kinsfolk, and his wife, a practical woman,
kept his house well. It is questionable, however, whether his habits
were ever reclaimed, and he died before the dissolution of the Beejapoor
kingdom. His wife, finding the care of the troop-horses irksome,
sold them, returned with her children to the family estate, and
settled there, and their descendants are now connected with many of
the noble families of the Dekhan.</p>

<p>The hunchback, Lukshmun, after his return home, took to Itga
all that he had saved, together with a heavy purse of gold which
Fazil Khan had given him, which he buried immediately on his
arrival. Somehow or other, however, the fact of this gold being
possessed by him, got wind, and the idea of a mere retainer possessing
gold at all, was too much to be endured by his avaricious master,
who demanded to see it. We are sorry to record, that the poor fellow
was obliged to submit to some rough torture, which was more than
he could bear, ere he would surrender it; but Lukshmun always
supposed that it was by the desertion of his master at Tooljapoor, rather
than by the possession of the gold, that evil eyes fell upon him; and
perhaps he was right. The gold was given up to his chief, and by
it the last link between them was broken; and profiting by Pahar
Singh's temporary absence, Lukshmun, taking his wife and children
with him, left Itga one day, and returned to Afzoolpoor, where Fazil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[530]</a></span>
Khan's retainers were stationed, and was protected by them. Pahar
Singh threatened to burn the town if he were not given up; but
Fazil Khan paid what was demanded for him, and he remained.</p>

<p>Years afterwards, and as his lord's children grew up, the hunchback
was their especial favourite. He taught the eldest boys athletic
exercises, the use of their weapons, and riding; and as long as any
girl was allowed to go out of the private apartments, he carried her
about in his arms, told charming fairy stories, and manufactured
playthings&mdash;his dolls, being of all, the most hideous, and most delightful.
Nor was there any greater treat to the children possible, than
when their mother sometimes, and especially on certain anniversaries,
sent for the hunchback and Ashruf, now a stout cavalier in the household
troop, and having seated them outside a screen, made them sing
ballads again as they did once long ago; and of all their store, "The
Vow of the Necklace," was ever the greatest favourite with the
children, because their mother's name was mentioned in it. With her,
because&mdash;well, no matter: we know why, long since, and 'tis now
an old story.</p>

<p>Many years before them, and in all honour among her children, as
she always called them, the lady Lurlee passed away. She never
gave up astrology, and found perpetual occupation in discovering
lucky days for her grandchildren's wants, and for all sorts of household
observances. Not a tooth could be cut, or any ailment of childhood
exist and pass away, without appropriate ceremonials of thanksgiving,
in the discovery of proper times for which, the old lady was
held to be especially skilful. Nor in these only. Was she not the
authority of the neighbourhood for ascertaining lucky marriages, for
deciding the proper colours for proper days of her grandchildren's
dresses; and did not she keep the cords of all their birthdays, and
tie the knots in each as the anniversaries returned? Was she not
the undisputed director of all such household family matters, and
the universal referee on them by all her acquaintance?</p>

<p>Her affection for Zyna and her children remained to the last,
though she never cordially liked Kowas Khan, or forgave him for
being the son of one who had been a slave. But her love for her
own child, Tara&mdash;the child whom God had sent her&mdash;transcended
that for Zyna. It filled her heart, and overflowed upon her grandchildren,
who loved her dearly, and did with her pretty much what
they pleased. After Kowas Khan's death she went to Zyna, and
lived with her till her son was old enough to protect his mother;
then she settled finally into the place she held with Tara and her
children; and when she breathed her last, her head lay on Tara's
bosom&mdash;resting peacefully.</p>

<p>With her outward conversion to a strange faith, did Tara forget
the old? No, it was impossible. Though her studious disposition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[531]</a></span>
enabled her to master enough Arabic, under her husband's teaching,
to understand the daily prayers, and some simple ceremonials, yet
the grand old Hindu hymns of the Védas, and other devotional portions
of the Shastras, especially the Bhugwat Geeta, were never forgotten;
and when the purport of them was explained to her husband,
he did not object to her reading them. She could not either, change
her frugal mode of living; and, to her death, never overcame her
natural repugnance to animal food. In this respect also, her husband
indulged her; though perhaps the lady Lurlee thought it a sad dereliction
of orthodox observances in general, which could only be overcome
on the festivals of the Nowroz or the Bukreed, or other occasions
of religious ceremonial.</p>

<p>When Tara was dying, and the Moollas without were chanting
the service for her departing soul, her eyes seemed once to flash
with a bright radiance, and her husband and children, who, were
around her, heard her say gently, "I come, O Mother," and repeat
some Sanscrit words. The priests, jealous of her perfect conversion,
would have it, that she alluded to Miriam, the Mother of Jesus of
Nazareth, for there could be no other Mother. It might, indeed, be
so, for she seemed of late to have taken a peculiar delight and interest
in this history, especially since some Christian monks from Goa, who
had established a mission<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> at the town of Chittapoor, only a few
miles distant, had come to beg alms of her, and had told her of the
purer faith of Christ, and his loving mother Mary. It might have
been that she spoke of this; or, more probable perhaps, that her
spirit, trembling on the brink of the unknown world, had wandered
back into the old days of her trials and deliverances, once, ere it departed.</p>
